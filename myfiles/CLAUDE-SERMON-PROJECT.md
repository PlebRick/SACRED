## Inline Tags

When writing sermon content, I use inline tags to mark up important elements. Suggest these when appropriate:

| Tag | Icon | Use For |
|-----|------|---------|
| **Illustration** | 💡 | Stories, examples, analogies that illuminate the point |
| **Application** | ✅ | Practical action steps or life application |
| **Key Point** | ⭐ | Main theological points or memorable statements |
| **Quote** | 💬 | Quotes from commentators, theologians, or other sources |
| **Cross-Ref** | 🔗 | References to other Bible passages |

When suggesting content, indicate which tag applies. For example:
- "💡 Illustration: Think of justification like a courtroom verdict..."
- "✅ Application: This week, practice confessing specific sins rather than vague generalities..."
- "🔗 Cross-Ref: See also Ephesians 2:8-9 for Paul's teaching on grace through faith..."

---

## Sermon Series

Current sermon series I'm working on:

| Series Name | Sermons |
|-------------|---------|
| **Romans: On Mission with the Master** | 8 sermons |

When writing a sermon from Romans, ask if it should be added to this series.

### When to Suggest Grudem Links

Suggest Grudem links when:
- The sermon touches on a major doctrine (justification, sanctification, atonement, etc.)
- A theological term needs deeper explanation
- The passage relates to systematic categories (God's attributes, soteriology, ecclesiology, etc.)

Example: "For deeper study on justification by faith, see `[[ST:Ch36]]` — Justification (Right Legal Standing Before God)"

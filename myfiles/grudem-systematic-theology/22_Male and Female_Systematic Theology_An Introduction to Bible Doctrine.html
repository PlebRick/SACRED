	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We noted in the previous chapter that one aspect of man&rsquo;s creation in the image of God is his creation as male and female: &ldquo;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; <span style="font-style:italic;">male and female he created them</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.27">Gen. 1:27</a>). The same connection between creation in the image of God and creation as male and female is made in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.1-2">Genesis 5:1&ndash;2</a>, &ldquo;When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. <span style="font-style:italic;">Male and female</span> he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.&rdquo; Although the creation of man as male and female is not the only way in which we are in the image of God, it is a significant enough aspect of our creation in the image of God that Scripture mentions it in the very same verse in which it describes God&rsquo;s initial creation of man. We may summarize the ways in which our creation as male and female represents something of our creation in God&rsquo;s image as follows:

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God did not create human beings to be isolated persons, but, in making us in his image, he made us in such a way that we can attain interpersonal unity of various sorts in all forms of human society. Interpersonal unity can be especially deep in the human family and also in our spiritual family, the church. Between men and women, interpersonal unity comes to its fullest expression in this age in marriage, where husband and wife become, in a sense, two persons in one: &ldquo;Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.24">Gen. 2:24</a>). This unity is not only a physical unity; it is also a <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 455  </span>spiritual and emotional unity of profound dimensions. A husband and wife joined together in marriage are people that &ldquo;God has joined together&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt19.6">Matt. 19:6</a>). Sexual union with someone other than one&rsquo;s own wife or husband is a specially offensive kind of sin against one&rsquo;s own body (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.16">1 Cor. 6:16</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.18-20">18&ndash;20</a>), and, within marriage, husbands and wives no longer have exclusive rule over their own bodies, but share them with their spouses (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.3-5">1 Cor. 7:3&ndash;5</a>). Husbands &ldquo;should love their wives as their own bodies&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.28">Eph. 5:28</a>). The union between husband and wife is not temporary but lifelong (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mal2.14-16">Mal. 2:14&ndash;16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro7.2">Rom. 7:2</a>), and it is not trivial but is a profound relationship created by God in order to picture the relationship between Christ and his church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.23-32">Eph. 5:23&ndash;32</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that God created two distinct persons as male and female, rather than just one man, is part of our being in the image of God because it can be seen to reflect to some degree the plurality of persons within the Trinity. In the verse prior to the one that tells of our creation as male and female, we see the first explicit indication of a plurality of persons within God: &ldquo;Then God said, &ldquo;Let <span style="font-style:italic;">us</span> make man in <span style="font-style:italic;">our</span> image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.26">Gen. 1:26</a>). There is some similarity here: just as there was fellowship and communication and sharing of glory among the members of the Trinity before the world was made (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.5">John 17:5</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.24">24</a>, and chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.14.0.0.0.0.0">14</a> on the Trinity, above), so God made Adam and Eve in such a way that they would share love and communication and mutual giving of honor to one another in their interpersonal relationship. Of course such reflection of the Trinity would come to expression in various ways within human society, but it would certainly exist from the beginning in the close interpersonal unity of marriage.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Someone might object that such a representation of the plurality of persons in God is not really a complete one, for God is three persons in one while God created Adam and Eve as only two persons in one. If God intended us to reflect the plurality of persons in the Trinity, why did he not create three persons rather than two who could reflect the interpersonal unity among the members of the Trinity? First, we must agree that this fact shows the analogy between marriage and the Trinity to be an inexact one. Second, although we cannot be certain of the reasons why God did not do something when Scripture does not explicitly tell us those reasons, we can suggest two possible answers: (1) The fact that God is three in one while Adam and Eve were only two in one may be a reminder that God&rsquo;s own excellence is far greater than ours, that he possesses far greater plurality and far greater unity than we ourselves, as creatures, can possess. (2) Though the unity is not exactly the same, the unity in a family among husband, wife, and children, does also reflect to some degree the interpersonal unity yet diversity of persons among the members of the Trinity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A second objection might be raised from the fact that Jesus himself was unmarried, that Paul was unmarried at the time he was an apostle (and perhaps earlier), and that Paul in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.1">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.7-9">7&ndash;9</a> seems to say that it is better for Christians not to marry. If marriage is such an important part of our reflection of the image of God, then why were Paul and Jesus not married, and why did Paul encourage others not to be married?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For Jesus, the situation is unique, for he is both God and man, and sovereign Lord over all creation. Rather than being married to any one individual human being, he has taken the entire church as his bride (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.23-32">Eph. 5:23&ndash;32</a>) and enjoys <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 456  </span>with each member of his church a spiritual and emotional unity that will last for eternity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The situation with Paul and his advice to the Corinthian Christians is somewhat different. There Paul does not say that it is wrong to marry (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.28">1 Cor. 7:28</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.36">36</a>), but rather views marriage as something good, a right and a privilege that may be given up for the sake of the kingdom of God: &ldquo;I think that in view of the present distress it is well for a person to remain as he is … the appointed time has grown very short … For the form of this world is passing away&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.26">1 Cor. 7:26</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.29">29</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.31">31</a>). In this way Paul gives up one way in which he might reflect likeness to God (marriage) in order to further other ways in which he might reflect likeness to God and further God&rsquo;s purposes in the world (namely, in his work for the church). For example, his evangelism and discipleship are thought of as bearing &ldquo;spiritual children&rdquo; and nurturing them in the Lord (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.14">1 Cor. 4:14</a>, where he calls the Corinthians &ldquo;my beloved children&rdquo;; also <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.19">Gal. 4:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti1.2">1 Tim. 1:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.4">Titus 1:4</a>). Moreover, the entire building up of the church was a process of bringing thousands of people to glorify God as they reflected his character more fully in their lives. In addition, we must realize that marriage is not the only way in which the unity and diversity in the Trinity can be reflected in our lives. It is also reflected in the union of believers in the fellowship of the church&mdash;and in genuine church fellowship, single persons (like Paul and Jesus) as well as those who are married can have interpersonal relationships that reflect the nature of the Trinity. Therefore, building the church and increasing its unity and purity also promote the reflection of God&rsquo;s character in the world.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Equality in Personhood and Importance</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Just as the members of the Trinity are equal in their importance and in their full existence as distinct persons (see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.14.0.0.0.0.0">14</a>, above), so men and women have been created by God to be equal in their importance and personhood. When God created man, he created both &ldquo;male and female&rdquo; in his image (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.27">Gen. 1:27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.1-2">5:1&ndash;2</a>). Men and women are made <span style="font-style:italic;">equally in God&rsquo;s image</span> and both men and women reflect God&rsquo;s character in their lives. This means that we should see aspects of God&rsquo;s character reflected in each other&rsquo;s lives. If we lived in a society consisting of only Christian men or a society consisting of only Christian women, we would not gain as full a picture of the character of God as when we see both godly men and godly women in their complementary differences together reflecting the beauty of God&rsquo;s character.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But if we are equally in God&rsquo;s image, then certainly men and women are <span style="font-style:italic;">equally important</span> to God and <span style="font-style:italic;">equally valuable</span> to him. We have equal worth before him for all eternity. The fact that both men and women are said by Scripture to be &ldquo;in the image of God&rdquo; should exclude all feelings of pride or inferiority and any idea that one sex is &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo; than the other. In particular, in contrast to many non-Christian cultures and religions, no one should feel proud or superior because he is a man, and no one should feel disappointed or inferior because she is a woman. If God thinks us to be equal in value, then that settles the question, for God&rsquo;s evaluation is the true standard of personal value for all eternity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 457  </span>When in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.7">1 Corinthians 11:7</a> Paul says, &ldquo;A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man,&rdquo; he is not denying that woman was created in the image of God. He is simply saying that there are abiding differences between men and women that should be reflected in the way they dress and act in the assembled congregation. One of those differences is that man in relationship to woman has a particular role of representing God or showing what he is like, and woman in that relationship shows the excellence of the man from whom she was created. Yet in both cases Paul goes on to emphasize their interdependence (see vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.11-12">11&ndash;12</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Our equality as persons before God, reflecting the equality of persons in the Trinity, should lead naturally to men and women giving honor to one another. <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr31">Proverbs 31</a> is a beautiful picture of the honor given to a godly woman:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		A good wife who can find?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		She is far more precious than jewels …
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Her children rise up and call her blessed;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		her husband also, and he praises her:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		&ldquo;Many women have done excellently,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		but you surpass them all.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		but a woman who fears the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> is to be praised.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-right:36pt; text-align:right;" lang="en-US">
		(<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr31.10">Prov. 31:10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr31.28-30">28&ndash;30</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, Peter tells husbands that they are to &ldquo;bestow honor&rdquo; on their wives (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.7">1 Peter 3:7</a>), and Paul emphasizes, &ldquo;In the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.11">1 Cor. 11:11</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.12">12</a>). Both men and women are equally important; both depend upon each other; both are worthy of honor.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The equality in personhood with which men and women were created is emphasized in a new way in the new covenant church. At Pentecost we see the fulfillment of Joel&rsquo;s prophecy in which God promises:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		&ldquo;I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		and your <span style="font-style:italic;">sons</span> and your <span style="font-style:italic;">daughters</span> shall prophesy
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		… and on my <span style="font-style:italic;">menservants</span> and my <span style="font-style:italic;">maidservants</span> in those days
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-right:36pt; text-align:right;" lang="en-US">
		(<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.17-18">Acts 2:17&ndash;18</a>; quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Joe2.28-29">Joel 2:28&ndash;29</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Holy Spirit is poured out in new power on the church, and men and women <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> are given gifts to minister in remarkable ways. Spiritual gifts are distributed to all men and women, beginning at Pentecost and continuing throughout the history of the church. Paul regards every Christian as a valuable member of the body of Christ, for &ldquo;to <span style="font-style:italic;">each</span> is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 458  </span>common good&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.7">1 Cor. 12:7</a>). After mentioning several gifts he says, &ldquo;All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions <span style="font-style:italic;">to each one</span> individually as he wills,&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.11">1 Cor. 12:11</a>). Peter also, in writing to many churches throughout Asia Minor, says, &ldquo;As <span style="font-style:italic;">each</span> has received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God&rsquo;s varied grace&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.10">1 Peter 4:10</a>). These texts do not teach that all believers have the same gifts, but they do mean that both men and women will have valuable gifts for the ministry of the church, and that we should expect that these gifts will be widely and freely distributed to both men and women.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It seems, therefore, pointless to ask, &ldquo;Who can pray more effectively, men or women?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Who can sing praise to God better, men or women?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Who will have more spiritual sensitivity and depth of relationship with God?&rdquo; To all of these questions, we simply cannot give an answer. Men and women are equal in their ability to receive the new covenant empowerment of the Holy Spirit. There have been both great men and great women of God throughout the history of the church. Both men and women have been mighty warriors in prayer, prevailing over earthly powers and kingdoms and spiritual strongholds in the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Equality before God is further emphasized in the new covenant church in the ceremony of baptism. At Pentecost, both men and women who believed were baptized: &ldquo;those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.41">Acts 2:41</a>). This is significant because in the old covenant, the sign of membership of God&rsquo;s people was circumcision, which was given only to men. The new sign of membership of God&rsquo;s people, the sign of baptism, given to both men and women, is further evidence that both should be seen as fully and equally members of the people of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Equality in status among God&rsquo;s people is also emphasized by Paul in Galatians: &ldquo;For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, <span style="font-style:italic;">there is neither male nor female;</span> for you are all one in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.27-28">Gal. 3:27&ndash;28</a>). Paul is here underlining the fact that no class of people, such as the Jewish people who had come from Abraham by physical descent, or the freedmen who had greater economic and legal power, could claim special status or privilege in the church. Slaves should not think themselves inferior to free men or women, nor should the free think themselves superior to slaves. Jews should not think themselves superior to Greeks, nor should Greeks think themselves inferior to Jews. Similarly, Paul wants to insure that men will not adopt some of the attitudes of the surrounding culture, or even some of the attitudes of first-century Judaism, and think that they have greater importance than women or are of superior value before God. Nor should women think themselves inferior or less important in the church. Both men and women, Jews and Greeks, slaves and free, are equal in importance and <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 459  </span>value to God and equal in membership in Christ&rsquo;s body, the church, for all eternity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In practical terms, we must never think that there are any second-class citizens in the church. Whether someone is a man or woman, employer or employee, Jew or Gentile, black or white, rich or poor, healthy or ill, strong or weak, attractive or unattractive, extremely intelligent or slow to learn, all are equally valuable to God and should be equally valuable to one another as well. This equality is an amazing and wonderful element of the Christian faith and sets Christianity apart from almost all religions and societies and cultures. The true dignity of godly manhood and womanhood can be fully realized only in obedience to God&rsquo;s redeeming wisdom as found in Scripture.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. Differences in Roles</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Relationship Between the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Trinity</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> and Male Headship in Marriage</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Between the members of the Trinity there has been equality in importance, personhood, and deity throughout all eternity. But there have also been differences in roles between the members of the Trinity. God the Father has always been the Father and has always related to the Son as a Father relates to his Son. Though all three members of the Trinity are equal in power and in all other attributes, the Father has a greater authority. He has a leadership role among all the members of the Trinity that the Son and Holy Spirit do not have. In creation, the Father speaks and initiates, but the work of creation is carried out through the Son and sustained by the continuing presence of the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.1-2">Gen. 1:1&ndash;2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.1-3">John 1:1&ndash;3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.6">1 Cor. 8:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.2">Heb. 1:2</a>). In redemption, the Father sends the Son into the world, and the Son comes and is obedient to the Father and dies to pay for our sins (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk22.42">Luke 22:42</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.6-8">Phil. 2:6&ndash;8</a>). After the Son has ascended into heaven, the Holy Spirit comes to equip and empower the church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn16.7">John 16:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.8">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.1-36">2:1&ndash;36</a>). The Father did not come to die for our sins, nor did the Holy Spirit. The Father was not poured out on the church at Pentecost in new covenant power, nor was the Son. Each member of the Trinity has distinct roles or functions. Differences in roles and authority between the members of the Trinity are thus completely consistent with equal importance, personhood, and deity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If human beings are to reflect the character of God, then we would expect some similar differences in roles among human beings, even with respect to the most basic of all differences among human beings, the difference between male and female. And this is certainly what we find in the biblical text.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul makes this parallel explicit when he says, &ldquo;I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, <span style="font-style:italic;">the head of a woman is her husband</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">the head of Christ is God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.3">1 Cor. 11:3</a>).

		Just as God the Father has authority over the Son, though the two are equal in deity, so in a marriage, the husband has authority over the wife, though they are equal in personhood. In this case, the man&rsquo;s role is like that of God the Father, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 460  </span>and the woman&rsquo;s role is parallel to that of God the Son. They are equal in importance, but they have different roles. In the context of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.2-16">1 Corinthians 11:2&ndash;16</a>, Paul sees this as a basis for telling the Corinthians to wear the different kinds of clothing appropriate for the men and women of that day, so that the distinctions between men and women might be outwardly evident in the Christian assembly.

Indications of Distinct Roles Before the Fall</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> But were these distinctions between male and female roles part of God&rsquo;s original creation, or were they introduced as part of the punishment of the fall?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, if we examine the text of the creation narrative in Genesis, we see several indications of <span style="font-style:italic;">differences in role</span> between Adam and Eve <span style="font-style:italic;">even before there was sin in the world</span>.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Adam Was Created First, Then Eve</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The fact that God first created Adam, then after a period of time created Eve (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.7">Gen. 2:7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.18-23">18&ndash;23</a>), suggests that God saw Adam as having a leadership role in his family. No such two-stage procedure is mentioned for any of the animals God made, but here it seems to have a special purpose. The creation of Adam first is consistent with the Old Testament pattern of &ldquo;primogeniture,&rdquo; the idea that the firstborn in any generation in a human family has leadership in the family for that generation. The right of primogeniture is assumed throughout the Old Testament text, even when at times because of God&rsquo;s special purposes the birthright is sold or otherwise transferred to a younger person (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge25.27-34">Gen. 25:27&ndash;34</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge35.23">35:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge38.27-30">38:27&ndash;30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge49.3-4">49:3&ndash;4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt21.15-17">Deut. 21:15&ndash;17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ch5.1-2">1 Chron. 5:1&ndash;2</a>). The &ldquo;birthright&rdquo; belongs to the firstborn son and is his unless special circumstances intervene to change that fact. The fact that we are correct in seeing a purpose of God in creating Adam first, and that this purpose reflects an abiding distinction in the roles God has given to men and women, is supported by <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.13">1 Timothy 2:13</a>, where Paul uses the fact that &ldquo;Adam was formed first, then Eve&rdquo; as a reason for restricting some distinct governing and teaching roles in the church to men.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Eve Was Created as a Helper for Adam</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Scripture specifies that God made Eve for Adam, not Adam for Eve. God said, &ldquo;It is not good that the man should be alone; <span style="font-style:italic;">I will make him a helper fit for him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.18">Gen. 2:18</a>). Paul sees this as significant enough to base a requirement for differences between men and women in worship on it. He says, &ldquo;Neither was man created for woman, but <span style="font-style:italic;">woman for man</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.9">1 Cor. 11:9</a>). This should not be taken to imply lesser importance, but it does indicate that there was a difference in roles from the beginning.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Recently some writers have denied that the creation of Eve as a helper fit for Adam signals any difference in role or authority, because the word <span style="font-style:italic;">helper</span> (Heb., <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">עֵזֶר</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK6469">H6469</a>) is often used in the Old Testament of someone who is greater or more powerful than the one who is being helped. In fact, the word <span style="font-style:italic;">helper</span> is used in the Old Testament of God himself who helps his people. But the point is that whenever someone &ldquo;helps&rdquo; someone else, whether in the Hebrew Old Testament <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 462  </span>or in our modern-day use of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">help</span> in the specific task in view the person who is helping is occupying a subordinate or inferior position with regard to the person being helped. That is true even when I &ldquo;help&rdquo; a young boy in my neighborhood to fix his bicycle&mdash;it is his responsibility, and his task, and I am only giving some assistance as needed; it is not my responsibility. David Clines concludes that this is the case throughout the Hebrew Old Testament:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What I conclude, from viewing all of the occurrences in the Hebrew Bible, is that though superiors may help inferiors, strong may help weak, gods may help humans, in the act of helping they are being &ldquo;inferior.&rdquo; That is to say, they are subjecting themselves to a secondary, subordinate position. Their help may be necessary or crucial, but they are assisting some task that is someone else&rsquo;s responsibility. They are not actually doing the task themselves, or even in cooperation, for there is different language for that. Being a helper is not a Hebrew way of being an equal.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another objection is that the Hebrew term translated &ldquo;fit for&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.18">Genesis 2:18</a> implies that Eve was actually superior to Adam, because the term really means &ldquo;in front of.&rdquo; But Raymond C. Ortlund correctly points out that the Hebrew term cannot mean &ldquo;superior to&rdquo; or <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps119.168">Psalm 119:168</a> would have the psalmist saying to God, &ldquo;All my ways are <span style="font-style:italic;">superior</span> to you&rdquo;! It simply means &ldquo;corresponding to.&rdquo;

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. Adam Named Eve</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The fact that Adam gave names to all the animals (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.19-20">Gen. 2:19&ndash;20</a>) indicated Adam&rsquo;s authority over the animal kingdom, because in Old Testament thought the right to name someone implied authority over that person (this is seen both when God gives names to people such as Abraham and Sarah, and when parents give names to their children). Since a Hebrew name designated the character or function of someone, Adam was specifying the characteristics or functions of the animals he named. Therefore when Adam named Eve by saying, &ldquo;She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.23">Gen. 2:23</a>), it indicated a leadership role on his part as well. This is true before the fall, where Adam names his wife &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; and it is true after the fall as well, when &ldquo;the man called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.20">Gen. 3:20</a>). Some have objected that Adam doesn&rsquo;t really name Eve before the fall. But certainly calling his wife &ldquo;Woman&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.23">Gen. 2:23</a>), just as he called all the living creatures by their names (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.19-20">Gen. 2:19&ndash;20</a>), is giving her a name. The fact that mothers sometimes give their children names in the Old Testament does not contradict the idea of name-giving as representing authority, since both mothers and fathers have parental authority over their children.

This is similar to the custom of a woman taking the last name of the man when she marries: it signifies his headship in the family.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">e. The Serpent Came to Eve First</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Satan, after he had sinned, was attempting to distort and undermine everything that God had planned and created as good. It is likely that Satan (in the form of a serpent), in approaching Eve first, was attempting to institute a role reversal by tempting Eve to take the leadership in disobeying God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.1">Gen. 3:1</a>). This stands in contrast to the way God approached them, for when God spoke to them, he spoke to Adam first (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.15-17">Gen. 2:15&ndash;17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.9">3:9</a>). Paul seems to have this role reversal in mind when he says, &ldquo;Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.14">1 Tim. 2:14</a>). This at least suggests that Satan was trying to undermine the pattern of male leadership that God had established in the marriage by going first to the woman.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">f. God Spoke to Adam First After the Fall</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Just as God spoke to Adam on his own even before Eve was created (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.15-17">Gen. 2:15&ndash;17</a>), so, after the fall, even though Eve had sinned first, God <span style="font-style:italic;">came first to Adam</span> and called <span style="font-style:italic;">him</span> to account for his actions: &ldquo;But the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">God called to the man</span> and said to <span style="font-style:italic;">him</span> &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.9">Gen. 3:9</a>). God thought of Adam as the leader of his family, the one to be called to account first for what had happened in the family. It is significant that though this is after sin has occurred, it is before the statement to Eve, &ldquo;He shall rule over you&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.16">Genesis 3:16</a>, where some writers today claim male headship in the family began.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">g. Adam, Not Eve, Represented the Human Race</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Even though Eve sinned first (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.6">Gen. 3:6</a>), we are counted sinful because of Adam&rsquo;s sin, not because of Eve&rsquo;s sin. The New Testament tells us, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">In Adam</span> all die&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.22">1 Cor 15:22</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.49">49</a>), and, &ldquo;Many died through <span style="font-style:italic;">one man&rsquo;s</span> trespass&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.15">Rom. 5:15</a>; cf. vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.12-21">12&ndash;21</a>). This indicates that God had given Adam headship or leadership with respect to the human race, a role that was not given to Eve.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">h. The Curse Brought a Distortion of Previous Roles, Not the Introduction of New Roles</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> In the punishments God gave to Adam and Eve, he did not introduce new roles or functions, but simply introduced pain and distortion into the functions they previously had. Thus, Adam would still have primary responsibility for tilling the ground and raising crops, but the ground would bring forth &ldquo;thorns and thistles&rdquo; and in the sweat of his face he would eat bread (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.18">Gen. 3:18</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.19">19</a>). Similarly, Eve would still have the responsibility of bearing children, but to do so would become painful: &ldquo;In pain you shall bring forth children&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.16">Gen. </a><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 464  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.16">3:16</a>). Then God also introduced conflict and pain into the previously harmonious relationship between Adam and Eve. God said to Eve, &ldquo;Your <span style="font-style:italic;">desire</span> shall be <span style="font-style:italic;">for your husband</span> and he shall rule over you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.16">Gen. 3:16</a>). Susan Foh has effectively argued that the word translated &ldquo;desire&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">תְּשׁוּקָה</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK9592">H9592</a>) means &ldquo;desire to conquer,&rdquo; and that it indicates Eve would have a wrongful desire to usurp authority over her husband. If this understanding of the word &ldquo;desire&rdquo; is correct, as it seems to be, then it would indicate that God is introducing <span style="font-style:italic;">a conflict into the relationship</span> between Adam and Eve and a desire on Eve&rsquo;s part to rebel against Adam&rsquo;s authority.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Concerning Adam, God told Eve, &ldquo;He shall <span style="font-style:italic;">rule</span> over you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.16">Gen. 3:16</a>). Here the word &ldquo;rule&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">מָשַׁל</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK5440">H5440</a>) is a strong term usually used of monarchical governments, not generally of authority within a family. The word certainly does not imply any &ldquo;participatory&rdquo; government by those who are ruled, but rather has nuances of dictatorial or absolute, uncaring use of authority, rather than considerate, thoughtful rule. It suggests harshness rather than kindness. The sense here is that Adam will misuse his authority <span style="font-style:italic;">by ruling harshly</span> over his wife, again introducing pain and conflict into a relationship that was previously harmonious. It is not that Adam had no authority before the fall; it is simply that he will misuse it after the fall.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So in both cases, the curse brought a <span style="font-style:italic;">distortion</span> of Adam&rsquo;s humble, considerate leadership and Eve&rsquo;s intelligent, willing submission to that leadership which existed before the fall.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">i. Redemption in Christ Reaffirms the Creation Order</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> If the previous argument about the distortion of roles introduced at the fall is correct, then what we would expect to find in the New Testament is an undoing of the painful aspects of the relationship that resulted from sin and the curse. We would expect that in Christ, redemption would encourage wives not to rebel against their husbands&rsquo; authority and would encourage husbands not to use their authority harshly. In fact, that is indeed what we do find: &ldquo;Wives, <span style="font-style:italic;">be subject to your husbands</span> as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, <span style="font-style:italic;">love your wives</span> and do not be harsh with them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.18-19">Col. 3:18&ndash;19</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.22-33">Eph. 5:22&ndash;33</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt2.5">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.1-7">1 Peter 3:1&ndash;7</a>). If it were a sinful pattern for wives to be subject to their husbands&rsquo; authority, Peter and Paul would <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 465  </span>not have commanded it to be maintained in Christian marriages! They do not say, for example, &ldquo;Encourage thorns to grow in your garden,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Make childbirth as painful as possible,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stay alienated from God, cut off from fellowship with him!&rdquo; The redemption of Christ is aimed at <span style="font-style:italic;">removing</span> the results of sin and of the fall in every way: &ldquo;The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.8">1 John 3:8</a>). <span style="font-style:italic;">New Testament commands concerning marriage do not perpetuate any elements of the curse or any sinful behavior patterns;</span> they rather reaffirm the order and distinction of roles that were there from the beginning of God&rsquo;s good creation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In terms of practical application, as we grow in maturity in Christ, we will grow to delight in and rejoice in the God-ordained and wisely created differences in roles within the human family. When we understand this biblical teaching, both men and women should be able to say in their hearts, &ldquo;This is what God has planned, and it is beautiful and right, and I rejoice in the way he has made me and the distinct role he has given me.&rdquo; There is eternal beauty and dignity and rightness in this differentiation in roles both within the Trinity and within the human family. With no sense of &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse,&rdquo; and with no sense of &ldquo;more important&rdquo; or &ldquo;less important,&rdquo; both men and women should be able to rejoice fully in the way they have been made by God.

		While on the surface this would seem to confirm what we have argued above about the creation order for marriage, in recent years there has been some debate over the meaning of the verb &ldquo;be subject to&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ὑποτάσσω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5718">G5718</a>) in this passage. Some people have understood it to mean &ldquo;be thoughtful and considerate; act in love [toward one another].&rdquo; If it is understood in this sense, then the text does not teach that a wife has any unique responsibility to submit to her husband&rsquo;s authority, because both husband and wife need to be considerate and loving toward one another, and because according to this view submission to an authority is not seen in this passage.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The primary argument that has been used in favor of taking &ldquo;be subject to&rdquo; in the sense &ldquo;be considerate of&rdquo; is the use of <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ὑποτάσσω</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5718">G5718</a>) in <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.21">Ephesians 5:21</a>. There Paul tells Christians, &ldquo;Be subject <span style="font-style:italic;">to one another.</span>&rdquo; Several writers have argued that this means that every Christian should be subject to every other Christian, and wives and husbands especially should be &ldquo;subject to one another.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;mutual submission&rdquo; has often been used to describe this kind of relationship, and it has been understood to imply that there is no unique kind of submission that a wife owes to her husband.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, the following context defines what Paul means by &ldquo;be subject to one another&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.21">Ephesians 5:21</a>: he means &ldquo;Be subject <span style="font-style:italic;">to others in the church who are in positions of authority over you.</span>&rdquo; This is explained by what follows: wives are to be subject to husbands (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.22-24">Eph. 5:22&ndash;24</a>), but husbands are never told to be subject to wives. In fact, Paul tells wives to be subject &ldquo;to <span style="font-style:italic;">your own</span> husbands&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.22">Eph. 5:22</a>), not to everyone in the church or to all husbands! Children are to be subject to their parents (to &ldquo;obey&rdquo; them, <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.1-3">Eph. 6:1&ndash;3</a>), but parents are never told to be subject to or to obey their children. Servants are to be subject to (&ldquo;obey&rdquo;) their masters, but not masters to servants. Therefore, the idea of mutual submission (in the sense, &ldquo;everyone should be subject to everyone&rdquo;) is not affirmed in <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.21">Ephesians 5:21</a>. Similarly, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.18-19">Colossians 3:18&ndash;19</a> Paul says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them&rdquo; (see also <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt2.4-5">Titus 2:4&ndash;5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.1-7">1 Peter 3:1&ndash;7</a>).

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 467  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">D. Note on Application to Marriage</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If our analysis is correct, then there are some practical applications, particularly within marriage, and also with regard to relationships between men and women generally.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When husbands begin to act in selfish, harsh, domineering, or even abusive and cruel ways, they should realize that this is a result of sin, a result of the fall, and is destructive and contrary to God&rsquo;s purposes for them. To act this way will bring great destructiveness in their lives, especially in their marriages. Husbands must rather fulfill the New Testament commands to love their wives, honor them, be considerate of them, and put them first in their interests.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, when wives feel rebellious, resentful of their husband&rsquo;s leadership in the family, or when they compete with their husbands for leadership in the family, they should realize that this is a result of sin, a result of the fall. They should not act that way, because to do so will bring destructive consequences to their marriages as well. A wife desiring to act in accordance with God&rsquo;s pattern should rather be submissive to her husband and agree that he is the leader in their home and rejoice in that.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Once we have said this, we must realize that there are two other, nearly opposite, distortions of the biblical pattern that can occur. If tyranny by the husband and usurpation of authority by the wife are <span style="font-style:italic;">errors of aggressiveness</span> there are two other errors, <span style="font-style:italic;">errors of passivity</span> or laziness. For a husband, the other extreme from being a domineering &ldquo;tyrant&rdquo; is to be entirely passive and to fail to take initiative in the family&mdash;in colloquial terms, to be a &ldquo;wimp.&rdquo; In this distortion of the biblical pattern, a husband becomes so &ldquo;considerate&rdquo; of his wife that he allows her to make all the decisions and even agrees when she urges him to do wrong (note this behavior in Adam, Ahab, and Solomon, among others). Often such a husband is increasingly absent (either physically or emotionally) from the home and occupies his time almost exclusively with other concerns.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The corresponding error on the part of the wife, opposite of attempting to domineer or usurp authority over her husband, is becoming entirely passive, contributing nothing to the decision-making process of the family, and being unwilling to speak words of correction to her husband, even though he is doing wrong. Submission to authority does not mean being entirely passive and agreeing with everything that the person in authority says or suggests&mdash;it is certainly not that way when we are submissive to the authority of an employer or of government officials (we can certainly differ with our government and still be subject to it), or even of the authority of the officers in a church (we can be subject to them even though we may disagree with some of their decisions). A wife can certainly be subject to the authority of her husband and still participate fully in the decision-making process of the family.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Husbands, therefore, should aim for loving, considerate, thoughtful leadership in their families. Wives should aim for active, intelligent, joyful submission to their husbands&rsquo; authority. In avoiding both kinds of mistakes and following a biblical pattern, husbands and wives will discover true biblical manhood and womanhood <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 468  </span>in all of their noble dignity and joyful complementarity, as God created them to be, and will thus reflect more fully the image of God in their lives.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. If you are being honest about your feelings, do you think it is better to be a man or a woman? Are you happy with the gender God gave you or would you rather be a member of the opposite sex? How do you think God wants you to feel about that question?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. Can you honestly say that you think members of the opposite sex are equally valuable in God&rsquo;s sight?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Before reading this chapter, have you thought of relationships in the family as reflecting something of the relationships between members of the Trinity? Do you think that is a helpful way of looking at the family? How does that make you feel about your own family relationships? Are there ways in which you might reflect God&rsquo;s character more fully in your own family?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. How does the teaching of this chapter on differences in roles between men and women compare with some of the attitudes expressed in society today? If there are differences between what much of society is teaching and what Scripture teaches, do you think there will be times when it will be difficult to follow Scripture? What could your church do to help you in those situations?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. Even apart from the questions of marriage or romantic involvement, do you think God intends us to enjoy times of fellowship with mixed groups of other Christian men and women? Why do you think God puts in our heart the desire to enjoy such fellowship? Does it also reflect something of the plurality of persons in the Trinity, together with the unity of God? Does this help you understand how it is important that unmarried people be included fully in the activities of the church? Do you think that in the past some religious groups have tended to neglect the importance of this or even wrongly to forbid such mixed fellowship among Christians? What are the dangers that should be guarded against in those situations, however?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 6. If you are a husband, are you content with the role God has given you in your marriage? If you are a wife, are you content with the role God has given you in your marriage?

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Churches today have many different forms of government. The Roman Catholic Church has a worldwide government under the authority of the Pope. Episcopalian churches have bishops with regional authority, and archbishops over them. Presbyterian churches grant regional authority to presbyteries and national authority to general assemblies. On the other hand, Baptist churches and many other independent churches have no formal governing authority beyond the local congregation, and affiliation with denominations is on a voluntary basis.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Within local churches, Baptists often have a single pastor with a board of deacons, but some have a board of elders as well. Presbyterians have a board of elders and Episcopalians have a vestry. Other churches simply have a church board.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Is there a New Testament pattern for church government? Is any one form of church government to be preferred over another? These are the questions addressed in this chapter.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, at the outset it must be said that the form of church government is not a major doctrine like the Trinity, the deity of Christ, substitutionary atonement, or the authority of Scripture. Although I believe, after examining the New Testament evidence, that one particular form of church government is preferable to the others, nevertheless, each form has some weaknesses as well as strengths. And church history attests that several different forms of government have worked fairly well for several centuries. Moreover, while some aspects of church government seem to be reasonably clear from the New Testament, other matters (such as the way in which church officers should be chosen) are less clear, mainly because the New Testament evidence on them is not extensive, and thus our inferences from this evidence are less certain. It seems to me, then, that there ought to be room for evangelical Christians to differ amicably over this question, in the hope that further understanding may be gained. And it also seems that individual Christians&mdash;while they may have a preference for one system or another, and while they may wish at appropriate times to argue forcefully for one system over another&mdash;should nevertheless be willing to live and minister within any of several different Protestant systems of church government in which they may find themselves from time to time.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 905  </span>But I do not mean to say that this is an entirely unimportant matter. In this area as well as others, a church may be more or less pure. If there are clear New Testament patterns regarding some aspects of church government, then there will be negative consequences in our churches if we disregard them, even if we cannot foresee all of those consequences at the present time. Therefore Christians are certainly free to speak and write on this subject in order to work for increased purity in the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this chapter we shall first survey the New Testament data concerning church officers, especially <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle, elder</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">deacon</span>. Then we shall ask how church officers should be chosen. After that we shall look at two controversial questions: Which form of church government&mdash;if any&mdash;is closest to the New Testament pattern? And, may women serve as officers in the church?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Church Officers</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For purposes of this chapter, we will use the following definition: <span style="font-style:italic;">A church officer is someone who has been publicly recognized as having the right and responsibility to perform certain functions for the benefit of the whole church</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		According to this definition, elders and deacons would be considered officers in a church, as would the pastor (if that is a distinct office). The church treasurer and church moderator would also be officers (these titles may vary from church to church). All of these people have had public recognition, usually at a service in which they are &ldquo;installed&rdquo; or &ldquo;ordained&rdquo; in an office. In fact, they <span style="font-style:italic;">need</span> public recognition in order to fulfill their responsibilities: for example, it would not be appropriate for people to wonder from week to week who was to receive the offering and deposit it in the bank, or for various people to argue that they had been gifted to take that responsibility in any particular week! The orderly functioning of the church requires that one person be recognized as having that responsibility. Similarly, the pastor who is responsible to do Bible teaching each Sunday morning must be recognized as having the right and responsibility to do that (at least, in most forms of church government). If this were not the case, then many people might prepare sermons and all claim the right to preach, or on some Sundays no one might prepare. Similarly, in order for people to follow the elders of the church and look to them for guidance, they must know who the elders are.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		By contrast, many other people exercise gifts in the church, but we do not say they have an &ldquo;office&rdquo; because they do not need formal public recognition for their gifts to function. Those who have a gift of &ldquo;helps&rdquo; (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.28">1 Cor. 12:28</a>), or who have a gift of especially strong faith, or a gift of &ldquo;distinguishing between spirits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.10">1 Cor. 12:10</a>), or a gift of exhorting or contributing (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro12.8">Rom. 12:8</a>) do not need public recognition in order to function effectively in the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the material that follows, we shall see that the New Testament discusses one church office which was limited to the time when the early church was founded (the office of apostle), and two other church offices which continue throughout the church age (the offices of elder and deacon).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Apostle</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Earlier in this book we saw that the New Testament <span style="font-style:italic;">apostles</span> had a unique kind of authority in the early church: authority to speak and write words <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 906  </span>which were &ldquo;words of God&rdquo; in an absolute sense. To disbelieve or disobey them was to disbelieve or disobey God. The apostles, therefore, had the authority to write words which became words of Scripture. This fact in itself should suggest to us that there was something unique about the office of apostle, and that we would not expect it to continue today, for no one today can add words to the Bible and have them be counted as God&rsquo;s very words or as part of Scripture.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition, the New Testament information on the qualifications of an apostle and the identity of the apostles also leads us to conclude that the office was unique and limited to the first century, and that we are to expect no more apostles today. We shall see this as we ask the following questions: What were the requirements for being an apostle? Who were the apostles? How many apostles were there? And are there apostles today?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At the outset it must be made clear that the answers to these questions depend on what one means by the word <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span>. Today some people use the word <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span> in a very broad sense, to refer to an effective church planter, or to a significant missionary pioneer (&ldquo;William Carey was an apostle to India,&rdquo; for example). If we use the word <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span> in this broad sense, everyone would agree that there are still apostles today&mdash;for there are certainly effective missionaries and church planters today.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament itself has three verses in which the word <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span> (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀπόστολος</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK693">G693</a>) is used in a broad sense, not to refer to any specific church office, but simply to mean &ldquo;messenger.&rdquo; In <a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.25">Philippians 2:25</a>, Paul calls Epaphroditus &ldquo;your <span style="font-style:italic;">messenger</span> (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀπόστολος</span>) and minister to my need&rdquo;; in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co8.23">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>, Paul refers to those who accompanied the offering that he was taking to Jerusalem as &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">messengers</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">[</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀπόστολοι</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> from </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀπόστολος</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> (</span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK693"><span style="font-style:italic;">G693</span></a><span style="font-style:italic;">)]</span> of the churches&rdquo;; and in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.16">John 13:16</a>, Jesus says, &ldquo;Nor is <span style="font-style:italic;">he who is sent [</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀπόστολος</span><span style="font-style:italic;">]</span> greater than he who sent him.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But there is another sense for the word <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span>. Much more frequently in the New Testament the word refers to a special office, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">apostle of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Jesus Christ</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span>&rdquo; In this narrow sense of the term, there are no more apostles today, and we are to expect no more. This is because of what the New Testament says about the qualifications for being an apostle and about who the apostles were.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Qualifications of an Apostle</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The two qualifications for being an apostle were (1) having seen Jesus after his resurrection with one&rsquo;s own eyes (thus, being an &ldquo;eyewitness of the resurrection&rdquo;), and (2) having been specifically commissioned by Christ as his apostle.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that an apostle had to have seen the risen Lord with his own eyes is indicated by <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.22">Acts 1:22</a>, where Peter said that person to replace Judas &ldquo;must become with us <span style="font-style:italic;">a witness to his resurrection.</span>&rdquo; Moreover, it was &ldquo;to the apostles <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 907  </span>whom he had chosen&rdquo; that &ldquo;he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.2-3">Acts 1:2&ndash;3</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.33">4:33</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul makes much of the fact that he did meet this qualification even though it was in an unusual way (Christ appeared to him in a vision on the road to Damascus and appointed him as an apostle: <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.5-6">Acts 9:5&ndash;6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac26.15-18">26:15&ndash;18</a>). When he is defending his apostleship he says, &ldquo;Am I not an apostle? <span style="font-style:italic;">Have I not seen </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> our Lord?</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co9.1">1 Cor. 9:1</a>). And when recounting the people to whom Christ appeared after his resurrection, Paul says, &ldquo;Then <span style="font-style:italic;">he appeared to James</span> then <span style="font-style:italic;">to all the apostles</span>. Last of all, as to one untimely born, <span style="font-style:italic;">he appeared also to me</span>. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.7-9">1 Cor. 15:7&ndash;9</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These verses combine to indicate that unless someone had seen Jesus after the resurrection with his own eyes, he could not be an apostle.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The second qualification, specific appointment by Christ as an apostle, is also evident from several verses. First, though the term <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span> is not common in the gospels, the twelve disciples are called &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; specifically in a context where Jesus is commissioning them, &ldquo;sending them out&rdquo; to preach in his name:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every infirmity. The names of the twelve <span style="font-style:italic;">apostles</span> are these … <span style="font-style:italic;">These twelve </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> sent out</span> charging them, &ldquo;… preach as you go, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.1-7">Matt. 10:1&ndash;7</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, Jesus commissions his apostles in a special sense to be his &ldquo;witnesses … to the end of the earth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.8">Acts 1:8</a>). And in choosing another apostle to replace Judas, the eleven apostles did not take the responsibility on themselves, but prayed and asked the ascended Christ to make the appointment:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		&ldquo;Lord, who knows the hearts of all men, <span style="font-style:italic;">show which one of these two you have chosen</span> to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside …&rdquo; And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.24-26">Acts 1:24&ndash;26</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul himself insists that Christ personally appointed him as an apostle. He tells how, on the Damascus Road, Jesus told him that he was appointing him as an apostle to the Gentiles: &ldquo;I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and to bear witness … delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles&mdash;to whom I send you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac26.16-17">Acts 26:16&ndash;17</a>). He later affirms that he was specifically appointed by Christ as an apostle (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.1">Rom. 1:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.1">Gal. 1:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti1.12">1 Tim. 1:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.7">2:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.11">2 Tim. 1:11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Who Were Apostles?</span> The initial group of apostles numbered twelve&mdash;the eleven original disciples who remained after Judas died, plus Matthias, who replaced Judas: &ldquo;And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and <span style="font-style:italic;">he was enrolled with the eleven apostles</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.26">Acts 1:26</a>). So important was this original group of twelve apostles, the &ldquo;charter members&rdquo; of the office of apostle, that we read that their names are inscribed on the foundations of the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem: &ldquo;And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them <span style="font-style:italic;">the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.14">Rev. 21:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We might at first think that such a group could never be expanded, that no one could be added to it. But then Paul clearly claims that he, also, is an apostle. And <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 908  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.14">Acts 14:14</a> calls both Barnabas and Paul apostles: &ldquo;when <span style="font-style:italic;">the apostles Barnabas and Paul</span> heard of it …&rdquo; So with Paul and Barnabas there are fourteen &ldquo;apostles of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then James the brother of Jesus (who was not one of the twelve original disciples) seems to be called an apostle in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.19">Galatians 1:19</a>: Paul tells how, when he went to Jerusalem, &ldquo;I saw none of <span style="font-style:italic;">the other apostles</span> except James the Lord&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo; Then in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.9">Galatians 2:9</a> James is classified with Peter and John as &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; of the Jerusalem church. And in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.13-21">Acts 15:13&ndash;21</a>, James, along with Peter, exercises a significant leadership function in the Jerusalem Council, a function which would be appropriate to the office of apostle. Furthermore, when Paul is listing the resurrection appearances of Jesus he once again readily classifies James with the apostles:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then he appeared <span style="font-style:italic;">to James</span> then <span style="font-style:italic;">to all the apostles</span>. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.7-9">1 Cor. 15:7&ndash;9</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, the fact that James could write the New Testament epistle which bears his name would also be entirely consistent with his having the authority which belonged to the office of apostle, the authority to write words which were the words of God. All these considerations combine to indicate that James the Lord&rsquo;s brother was also commissioned by Christ as an apostle. That would bring the number to fifteen &ldquo;apostles of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (the twelve plus Paul, Barnabas, and James).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Were there more than these fifteen? There may possibly have been a few more, though we know little if anything about them, and it is not certain that there were any more. Others, of course, had seen Jesus after his resurrection (&ldquo;Then he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.6">1 Cor. 15:6</a>). From this large group it is possible that Christ appointed some others as apostles&mdash;but it is also very possible that he did not. The evidence is not sufficient to decide the issue.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.7">Romans 16:7</a> says, &ldquo;Greet <span style="font-style:italic;">Andronicus and Junias</span> my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners; they are <span style="font-style:italic;">men of note among the apostles</span> and they were in Christ before <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 909  </span>me.&rdquo; Because there are several translation problems in the verse, no clear conclusions can be reached. &ldquo;Men of note&rdquo; may be also translated &ldquo;men noted by&rdquo; (the apostles). &ldquo;Junias&rdquo; (a man&rsquo;s name) may also be translated &ldquo;Junia&rdquo; (a woman&rsquo;s name). &ldquo;Apostles&rdquo; here may not mean the office &ldquo;apostles of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; but may simply mean &ldquo;messengers&rdquo; (the broader sense which the word takes in <a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.25">Phil. 2:25</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co8.23">2 Cor. 8:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.16">John 13:16</a>). The verse has too little clear information to allow us to draw a conclusion.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Others have been suggested as apostles. Silas (Silvanus) and sometimes Timothy are mentioned because of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th2.6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>: &ldquo;though <span style="font-style:italic;">we</span> might have made demands <span style="font-style:italic;">as apostles of Christ.</span>&rdquo; Does Paul include Silas and Timothy here, since the letter begins, &ldquo;Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th1.1">1 Thess. 1:1</a>)?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is not likely that Paul is including Timothy in this statement, for two reasons. (1) He says just four verses earlier, &ldquo;we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th2.2">1 Thess. 2:2</a>), but this refers to the beating and imprisonment which happened just to Paul and Silas, not to Timothy (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.19">Acts 16:19</a>). So the &ldquo;we&rdquo; in verse <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.6">6</a> does not seem to include all of the people (Paul, Silvanus, Timothy) mentioned in the first verse. The letter in general is from Paul, Silas and Timothy, but Paul knows that the readers will naturally understand the appropriate members of the &ldquo;we&rdquo; statements when he does not mean to include all three of them in certain sections of the letter. He does not specify &ldquo;&mdash;that is, Silas and I&mdash;had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know,&rdquo; because the Thessalonians will know who the &ldquo;we&rdquo; are that he is talking about.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(2) This is also seen in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th3.1-2">1 Thessalonians 3:1&ndash;2</a>, where the &ldquo;we&rdquo; certainly cannot include Timothy:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left behind at Athens alone, and <span style="font-style:italic;">we sent Timothy</span> our brother and God&rsquo;s servant in the gospel of Christ, to establish you in your faith and to exhort you. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th3.1-2">1 Thess. 3:1&ndash;2</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this case, the &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers either to Paul and Silas, or else just to Paul alone (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.14-15">Acts 17:14&ndash;15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.5">18:5</a>). Apparently Silas and Timothy had come to Paul in Athens &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.15">Acts 17:15</a>)&mdash;though Luke does not mention their arrival in Athens&mdash;and Paul had sent them back to Thessalonica again to help the church there. Then he himself went to Corinth, and they later joined him there (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.5">Acts 18:5</a>).

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 910  </span>It is most likely that &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">We</span> were willing to be left behind at Athens alone&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th3.1">1 Thess. 3:1</a>), refers to Paul alone, both because he picks up the argument again in verse <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th3.5">5</a> with the singular &ldquo;I&rdquo; (&ldquo;When I could bear it no longer, I sent that I might know your faith,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th3.5">1 Thess. 3:5</a>), and because the point concerning extreme loneliness in Athens would not be made if Silas had stayed with him. In fact, in the previous paragraph, Paul means &ldquo;I,&rdquo; for he says, &ldquo;We wanted to come to you&mdash;I, Paul, again and again&mdash;but Satan hindered us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th2.18">1 Thess. 2:18</a>). Apparently he is using &ldquo;we&rdquo; more frequently in this epistle as a courteous way of including Silas and Timothy, who had spent so much time in the Thessalonian church, in the letter to that church. But the Thessalonians would have had little doubt who was really in charge of this great mission to the Gentiles, and on whose apostolic authority the letter primarily (or exclusively) depended.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So it is just possible that Silas was himself an apostle, and that <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th2.6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a> hints at that. He was a leading member of the Jerusalem church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.22">Acts 15:22</a>), and could well have seen Jesus after his resurrection, and then been appointed as an apostle. But we cannot be very certain.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The situation with Timothy is different, however. Just as he is excluded from the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th2.2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a> (and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th3.1-2">3:1&ndash;2</a>), so he seems to be excluded from the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th2.6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>. Moreover, as a native of Lystra (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.1-3">Acts 16:1&ndash;3</a>) who had learned of Christ from his grandmother and mother (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.5">2 Tim. 1:5</a>), it seems impossible that he would have been in Jerusalem before Pentecost and would there have seen the risen Lord and come to believe in him, and then suddenly have been appointed as an apostle. In addition, <span style="font-style:italic;">Paul&rsquo;s pattern of address in his letters always jealously guards the title &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; for himself</span> never allowing it to be applied to Timothy or others of his traveling companions (note <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co1.1">2 Cor. 1:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.1">Col. 1:1</a>: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Paul, an apostle</span> of Christ Jesus … <span style="font-style:italic;">and Timothy our brother</span>&rdquo;; and then <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.1">Phil. 1:1</a>: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Paul and Timothy, servants</span> of Christ Jesus&rdquo;). So Timothy, as important a role as he had, should not rightly be considered one of the apostles.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This gives us a limited but somewhat imprecisely numbered group who had the office &ldquo;apostles of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; There seem to have been at least fifteen, and perhaps sixteen or even a few more who are not recorded in the New Testament.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet it seems quite certain that there were none appointed after Paul. When Paul lists the resurrection appearances of Christ, he emphasizes the unusual way in which Christ appeared to him, and connects that with the statement that this was the &ldquo;last&rdquo; appearance of all, and that he himself is indeed &ldquo;the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle.&rdquo;

Summary</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The word <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span> can be used in a broad or narrow sense. In a broad sense, it just means &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; or &ldquo;pioneer missionary.&rdquo; But in a narrow sense, the most common sense in the New Testament, it refers to a specific office, &ldquo;apostle of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These apostles had unique authority to found and govern the early church, and they could speak and write words of God. Many of their written words became the New Testament Scriptures.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In order to qualify as an apostle, someone (1) had to have seen Christ with his own eyes after he rose from the dead, and (2) had to have been specifically appointed by Christ as an apostle. There was a limited number of apostles, perhaps fifteen or sixteen or a few more&mdash;the New Testament is not explicit on the number. The twelve original apostles (the eleven plus Matthias) were joined by Barnabas and Paul, very probably James, perhaps Silas, and maybe even Andronicus and Junias or a few unnamed others. It seems that no apostles were appointed after Paul, and certainly, since no one today can meet the qualification of having seen the risen Christ with his own eyes, there are no apostles today. In place of living apostles present in the church to teach and govern it, we have instead the writings of the apostles in the books of the New Testament. Those New Testament Scriptures fulfill for the church today the absolutely authoritative teaching and governing functions which were fulfilled by the apostles themselves during the early years of the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Though some may use the word <span style="font-style:italic;">apostle</span> in English today to refer to very effective church planters or evangelists, it seems inappropriate and unhelpful to do so, for it simply confuses people who read the New Testament and see the high authority that is attributed to the office of &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; there. It is noteworthy that no major leader in the history of the church&mdash;not Athanasius or Augustine, not Luther or Calvin, not Wesley or Whitefield&mdash;has taken to himself the title of &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; or let himself be called an apostle. If any in modern times want to take the title &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; to themselves, they immediately raise the suspicion that they may be motivated by inappropriate pride and desires for self-exaltation, along with excessive ambition and a desire for much more authority in the church than any one person should rightfully have.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Plural Elders: The Pattern in All New Testament Churches</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The next church office to be considered is that of &ldquo;elder.&rdquo; Although some have argued that different forms of church government are evident in the New Testament, a survey of the relevant texts shows the opposite to be true: there is quite a consistent pattern of <span style="font-style:italic;">plural elders</span> as the main governing group in New Testament churches. For instance, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.23">Acts 14:23</a> we read, &ldquo;And when they had appointed <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> for them in every church, with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.&rdquo; This is on Paul&rsquo;s first missionary journey, when he is returning through the cities of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. It indicates that Paul&rsquo;s normal procedure from the time of his first missionary journey was to establish a group of elders in each church shortly after the church began. We know that Paul also established elders in the church at Ephesus, for we read, &ldquo;From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> of the church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.17">Acts 20:17</a>). Moreover, Paul&rsquo;s apostolic assistants apparently were instructed to carry out a similar process, for Paul wrote to Titus, &ldquo;This is why I left you in Crete, that you might amend what was defective, and <span style="font-style:italic;">appoint elders in every town</span> as I directed you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5">Titus 1:5</a>). Shortly after a church has been established, once again we see elders being established in office, in &ldquo;every town&rdquo; in which there was a church. And Paul reminded Timothy of the time &ldquo;when the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> laid their hands upon you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti4.14">1 Tim. 4:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		James writes, &ldquo;Is any among you sick? Let him call for the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.14">James 5:14</a>). This is a significant statement because the epistle of James is a general letter written to many churches, all the believers scattered abroad, whom James characterizes as &ldquo;the twelve tribes in the Dispersion&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.1">James 1:1</a>). It indicates that James expected that there would be elders <span style="font-style:italic;">in every New Testament church to which his general epistle went</span>&mdash;that is, in <span style="font-style:italic;">all the churches in existence at that time</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A similar conclusion can be drawn from 1 Peter. Peter writes, &ldquo;So I exhort the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> among you … Tend the flock of God that is your charge …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.1-2">1 Peter 5:1&ndash;2</a>). First Peter is also a general epistle, written to dozens of churches scattered throughout four Roman provinces in Asia Minor (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.1">1 Peter 1:1</a>; Bithynia and Pontus constituted one Roman province). Far from expecting different kinds of church government when he was writing (around <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 62, more than thirty years after Pentecost), Peter assumes that <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> these churches, whether founded by Paul or by others, whether predominantly Gentile or predominantly Jewish or evenly divided in their make-up, would have elders leading them. Moreover, there were elders in the Jerusalem church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac11.30">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.2">15:2</a>), and, though the word <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> is not used, there is a plurality of leaders in the congregation to which the epistle to the Hebrews is directed, for the author says, &ldquo;Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.17">Heb. 13:17</a>).

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 913  </span>Two significant conclusions may be drawn from this survey of the New Testament evidence. First, no passage suggests that any church, no matter how small, had only one elder. The consistent New Testament pattern is a plurality of elders &ldquo;in every church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.23">Acts 14:23</a>) and &ldquo;in every town&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5">Titus 1:5</a>). Second, we do not see a diversity of forms of government in the New Testament church, but a unified and consistent pattern in which every church had elders governing it and keeping watch over it (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.28">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.17">Heb. 13:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.2-3">1 Peter 5:2&ndash;3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Other Names for Elders: Pastors, Overseers, Bishops</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Elders are also called &ldquo;pastors&rdquo; or &ldquo;bishops&rdquo; or &ldquo;overseers&rdquo; in the New Testament. The least commonly used word (at least in the noun form) is <span style="font-style:italic;">pastor</span> (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ποιμήν</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4478">G4478</a>). It may be surprising to us to find that this word, which has become so common in English, only occurs once in the New Testament when speaking about a church officer. In <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.11">Ephesians 4:11</a>, Paul writes, &ldquo;And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some <span style="font-style:italic;">pastors</span> and teachers.&rdquo; The verse is probably better translated &ldquo;pastor-teachers&rdquo; (one group) rather than &ldquo;pastors and teachers&rdquo; (suggesting two groups) because of the Greek construction (though not every New Testament scholar agrees with that translation). The connection with teaching suggests that these pastors were some (or perhaps all) of the elders who carried on the work of teaching, for one qualification for an elder is that he be &ldquo;able to teach&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Tim. 3:2</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although the noun <span style="font-style:italic;">pastor</span> (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ποιμήν</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4478">G4478</a>) is not used of church officers elsewhere in the New Testament, the related verb which means &ldquo;to act as a shepherd&rdquo; or &ldquo;to act as a pastor&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ποιμαίνω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4477">G4477</a>) is applied to elders in Paul&rsquo;s address to the Ephesian elders. He tells them &ldquo;to <span style="font-style:italic;">shepherd</span> the church of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.28">Acts 20:28</a>, literally translating the verb <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ποιμαίνω</span>), and in the same sentence he referred to God&rsquo;s people as &ldquo;all the <span style="font-style:italic;">flock,</span>&rdquo; using another related noun (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ποίμνιον</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4480">G4480</a>) which means &ldquo;a flock of sheep.&rdquo; So Paul directly charges these Ephesian elders to act as shepherds or &ldquo;pastors.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The same verb is used in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.2">1 Peter 5:2</a> where Peter tells the elders to &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">shepherd</span> (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ποιμαίνω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4477">G4477</a>) the flock of God that is your charge&rdquo; (author&rsquo;s translation). Then two verses later Jesus is called the chief pastor or &ldquo;chief shepherd&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀρχιποίμην</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK799">G799</a>) <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 914  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.4">1 Peter 5:4</a>), implying quite clearly that Peter also viewed the elders as shepherds or &ldquo;pastors&rdquo; in the church. Therefore, although the noun <span style="font-style:italic;">pastor</span> is only used once to refer to elders, the related verb is used twice in passages that explicitly identify the task of shepherding with the office of elder.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another term used for elders in the New Testament is a Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐπίσκοπος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2176">G2176</a>) which is variously translated as &ldquo;overseer&rdquo; or &ldquo;bishop,&rdquo; depending on the individual passage and the English translation. But this word also seems quite clearly to be another term for elders in New Testament usage. For example, when Paul has called to him the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> of the church at Ephesus (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.17">Acts 20:17</a>), he says to them, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you <span style="font-style:italic;">overseers</span> (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐπίσκοπος</span>)&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.28">Acts 20:28</a>). Paul quite readily refers to these Ephesian elders as &ldquo;overseers&rdquo; (or &ldquo;bishops&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.1-2">1 Timothy 3:1&ndash;2</a>, Paul writes, &ldquo;If any one aspires to the office of <span style="font-style:italic;">bishop</span> he desires a noble task. Now a bishop must be above reproach …&rdquo; We must remember that Paul is writing to Timothy when Timothy is at Ephesus (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti1.3">1 Tim. 1:3</a>, &ldquo;remain at Ephesus&rdquo;) and we already know from <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20">Acts 20</a> that there are <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> at Ephesus (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.17-38">Acts 20:17&ndash;38</a>). Furthermore, in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.17">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, we see that elders were ruling the church at Ephesus when Timothy was there, because it says, &ldquo;Let the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders who rule well</span> be considered worthy of double honor.&rdquo; Now the &ldquo;bishops&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.1-2">1 Timothy 3:1&ndash;2</a> <span style="font-style:italic;">also</span> are to rule over the church at Ephesus because one qualification is that &ldquo;He must manage his own household well … for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for God&rsquo;s church?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.4-5">1 Tim. 3:4&ndash;5</a>). So here it also seems that &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; or &ldquo;overseer&rdquo; is simply another term for &ldquo;elder,&rdquo; since these &ldquo;bishops&rdquo; fulfill the same function as elders quite clearly do elsewhere in this epistle and in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20">Acts 20</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5">Titus 1:5</a>, Paul tells Titus to &ldquo;appoint <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> in every town&rdquo; and gives some qualifications (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.6">6</a>). Then in the very next sentence (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.7">7</a>), he gives reasons for those qualifications, and he begins by saying, &ldquo;For a <span style="font-style:italic;">bishop</span> as God&rsquo;s steward, must be blameless.&rdquo; Here again he uses the word &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; to refer to the elders whom Titus was to appoint, giving another indication that the terms <span style="font-style:italic;">elder</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">bishop</span> were interchangeable.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.1">Philippians 1:1</a>, Paul writes &ldquo;To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the <span style="font-style:italic;">bishops</span> and deacons.&rdquo; Here it also seems appropriate to think that &ldquo;bishops&rdquo; is another name for &ldquo;elders,&rdquo; because there certainly were elders at Philippi, since it was Paul&rsquo;s practice to establish elders in every church (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.23">Acts 14:23</a>). And if there were elders ruling in the church at Philippi, it is unthinkable that Paul would write to the church and single out bishops and deacons&mdash;but not elders&mdash;if their offices were both different from that of the elders. Therefore, by &ldquo;bishops and deacons&rdquo; Paul must have meant the same thing as &ldquo;elders and deacons.&rdquo; Although in some parts of the church from the second century <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> onward, the word <span style="font-style:italic;">bishop</span> has been used to refer to a single individual with <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 915  </span>authority over several churches, this was a later development of the term and is not found in the New Testament itself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. The Functions of Elders</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> One of the major roles of elders in the New Testament is to govern the New Testament churches. In <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.17">1 Timothy 5:17</a> we read, &ldquo;Let the elders who <span style="font-style:italic;">rule</span> well be considered worthy of double honor.&rdquo; Earlier in the same epistle Paul says that an overseer (or elder) &ldquo;must manage his own household well, keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way; for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for God&rsquo;s church?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.4-5">1 Tim. 3:4&ndash;5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Peter also indicates a ruling function for elders when he exhorts them:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Tend the flock of God that is your charge, not by constraint but willingly, not for shameful gain but eagerly, not as domineering over those in your charge but being examples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd is manifested you will obtain the unfading crown of glory. Likewise you that are younger be subject to the elders. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.2-5">1 Peter 5:2&ndash;5</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that they are to act as shepherds of the flock of God, and the fact that they are not to domineer (that is, not to rule harshly or oppressively) strongly suggest that elders have ruling or governing functions in the churches to which Peter is writing. This is consistent with his charge that especially those who are younger should &ldquo;be subject to the elders&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.5">5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.17">Hebrews 13:17</a> does not name elders, certainly there are some church officers with governing authority over the church, for the author says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Obey your leaders and submit to them;</span> for they are keeping watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account.&rdquo; Since the New Testament gives no indication of any other officers in the church with this kind of authority, it is reasonable to conclude that the congregation is to submit to and obey its elders. (This conclusion is also consistent with the description of responsibilities Paul gives to the Ephesian elders in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.28">Acts 20:28</a>.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition to governing responsibility, elders also seem to have had some <span style="font-style:italic;">teaching responsibilities</span> in the New Testament churches. In <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.11">Ephesians 4:11</a>, elders are referred to as &ldquo;pastor-teachers&rdquo; (or, on an alternative translation, pastors who are viewed as quite closely united to teachers). And in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, an overseer (elder) must be &ldquo;an <span style="font-style:italic;">apt teacher.</span>&rdquo; Then in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.17">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, Paul says, &ldquo;Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in <span style="font-style:italic;">preaching and teaching.</span>&rdquo; Here Paul seems to imply that there is a special group of elders who &ldquo;labor in preaching and teaching.&rdquo; This means at least that there are some among the elders who give more time to the activities of preaching and teaching, and may even mean that there are some who &ldquo;labor&rdquo; in the sense of earning their living from that preaching and teaching. The same conclusions can be drawn from Titus, where Paul says that an elder &ldquo;must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be <span style="font-style:italic;">able to give instruction</span> in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.9">Titus 1:9</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">d. Qualifications for Elders</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> When Paul lists the qualifications for elders, it is significant that he combines requirements concerning character traits and heart attitudes with requirements that cannot be fulfilled in a short time but will only become evident over a period of several years of faithful Christian living:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now a bishop must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, dignified, hospitable, an apt teacher, no drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and no lover of money. He must manage his own household well, keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way; for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for God&rsquo;s church? He must not be a recent convert, or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil; moreover he must be well thought of by outsiders, or he may fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2-7">1 Tim. 3:2&ndash;7</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similar but differently worded qualifications are found in <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.6-9">Titus 1:6&ndash;9</a>, where Paul says that Titus is to appoint elders in every town:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of being profligate or insubordinate. For a bishop, as God&rsquo;s steward, must be blameless; he must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of goodness, master of himself, upright, holy, and self-controlled; he must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.6-9">Titus 1:6&ndash;9</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Those who are choosing elders in churches today would do well to look carefully at candidates in the light of these qualifications, and to look for these character traits and patterns of godly living rather than worldly achievement, fame, or success. Especially in churches in western industrial societies, there seems to be a tendency to think that success in the world of business (or law, or medicine, or government) is an indication of suitability for the office of elder, but this is not the teaching of the New Testament. It reminds us that elders are to be &ldquo;examples to the flock&rdquo; in their daily lives, and that would certainly include their own personal relationships with God in Bible reading, prayer, and worship. Just as Paul could say, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Be imitators of me</span> as I am of Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.1">1 Cor. 11:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti3.10-11">2 Tim. 3:10&ndash;11</a>), and just as he could command Timothy to &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">set the believers an example</span> in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti4.12">1 Tim. 4:12</a>), and just as he could tell Titus, &ldquo;Show yourself in all respects a <span style="font-style:italic;">model of good deeds</span> and in your teaching show integrity, gravity, and sound speech that cannot be censured&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt2.7">Titus 2:7</a>), so the pattern is to be continued in the lives of all church leaders today. It is not optional that their lives be examples for others to follow; it is a requirement.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">e. What Is the Meaning of &ldquo;Husband of One Wife&rdquo;?</span> The qualification &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the husband of one wife</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Tim. 3:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.6">Titus 1:6</a>) has been understood in different ways. Some people have thought that it excludes from the office of elder men who have <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 917  </span>been divorced and have then married someone else, since they have then been the husband of two wives. But this does not seem to be a correct understanding of these verses. A better interpretation is that Paul was prohibiting a polygamist (a man who <span style="font-style:italic;">presently</span> has more than one wife) from being an elder. Several reasons support this view: (1) All the other qualifications listed by Paul refer to a man&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">present status</span> not his entire past life. For example, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.1-7">1 Timothy 3:1&ndash;7</a> does not mean &ldquo;one who has <span style="font-style:italic;">never been</span> violent,&rdquo; but &ldquo;one who is <span style="font-style:italic;">not now</span> violent, but gentle.&rdquo; It does not mean &ldquo;one who has <span style="font-style:italic;">never been</span> a lover of money,&rdquo; but &ldquo;one who is <span style="font-style:italic;">not now</span> a lover of money.&rdquo; It does not mean &ldquo;one who has been above reproach for his whole life,&rdquo; but &ldquo;one who is now above reproach.&rdquo; If we made these qualifications apply to one&rsquo;s entire past life, then we would exclude from office almost everyone who became a Christian as an adult, for it is doubtful that any non-Christian could meet these qualifications.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(2) Paul could have said &ldquo;having been married only once&rdquo; if he had wanted to, but he did not. (3) We should not prevent remarried widowers from being elders, but that would be necessary if we take the phrase to mean &ldquo;having been married only once.&rdquo; The qualifications for elders are all based on a man&rsquo;s moral and spiritual character, and there is nothing in Scripture to suggest that a man who remarried after his wife had died has lower moral or spiritual qualifications. (4) Polygamy was possible in the first century. Although it was not common, polygamy was practiced, especially among the Jews. The Jewish historian Josephus says, &ldquo;For it is an ancestral custom of ours to have several wives at the same time.&rdquo; Rabbinic legislation also regulated inheritance customs and other aspects of polygamy.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore it is best to understand &ldquo;the husband of one wife&rdquo; to prohibit a polygamist from holding the office of elder. The verses say nothing about divorce and remarriage with respect to qualifications for church office.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 918  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">f. The Public Installation of Elders</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> In connection with the discussion of elders Paul says, &ldquo;Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.22">1 Tim. 5:22</a>). Although the context does not specify a process of selection of elders, the immediately preceding context (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.17-21">1 Tim. 5:17&ndash;21</a>) deals entirely with elders, and laying on of hands would be an appropriate ceremony for setting someone apart to the office of elder (note the laying on of hands to ordain or establish people in certain offices or tasks in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.6">Acts 6:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.3">13:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti4.14">1 Tim. 4:14</a>). Therefore the setting apart of elders seems the most likely possibility for the action Paul has in mind. In this case he would be saying, &ldquo;Do not be hasty in ordaining people as elders.&rdquo; This would be consistent with a process whereby deacons also are to be &ldquo;tested first; then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.10">1 Tim. 3:10</a>). Although Paul did ordain elders quite soon after the establishment of each church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.23">Acts 14:23</a>), here he cautions that such appointment should not be rushed, lest a mistake be made. And in the entire process, the church must be careful not to judge as the world judges, for &ldquo;man looks on the outward appearance, but the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> looks on the heart&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa16.7">1 Sam. 16:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.16">2 Cor. 5:16</a>). This necessity for evaluation of spiritual condition was also evident when the apostles encouraged the church at Jerusalem to pick out &ldquo;seven men of good repute, <span style="font-style:italic;">full of the Spirit and of wisdom</span> whom we may appoint to this duty&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.3">Acts 6:3</a>). Among those chosen was &ldquo;Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.5">Acts 6:5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should also note that the appointment of elders in Paul&rsquo;s early churches was accompanied by &ldquo;prayer and fasting,&rdquo; perhaps in connection with the process of selection of the elders. (Note the example of Jesus who &ldquo;went out to the mountain to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God&rdquo; before he chose his twelve disciples [<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk6.12-13">Luke 6:12&ndash;13</a>].)

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Deacon</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The word <span style="font-style:italic;">deacon</span> is a translation of the Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">διάκονος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1356">G1356</a>) which is the ordinary word for &ldquo;servant&rdquo; when it is used in contexts not dealing with church officers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Deacons are mentioned clearly in <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.1">Philippians 1:1</a>: &ldquo;To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and <span style="font-style:italic;">deacons.</span>&rdquo; But there is no specification of their function, other than to indicate that they are different from the bishops (elders). Deacons are also mentioned in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.8-13">1 Timothy 3:8&ndash;13</a> in a more extensive passage:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Deacons likewise must be serious, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for gain; they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. And let them also be tested first; then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons. The women [or &ldquo;wives&rsquo;; the Greek can take either meaning] likewise must be serious, no slanderers, but temperate, faithful in all things. Let deacons be the husband of one wife, and let them manage their children and their households well; for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 919  </span>themselves and also great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.8-13">1 Tim. 3:8&ndash;13</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The function of deacons is not spelled out here, but the qualifications for deacons suggest some functions. For instance, they seem to have had some responsibility in caring for the finances of the church, since they had to be people who were &ldquo;not greedy for gain&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.8">8</a>). They perhaps had some administrative responsibilities in other activities of the church as well, because they were to manage their children and their households well (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.12">12</a>). They may also have ministered to the physical needs of those in the church or community who needed help (see discussion of <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6">Acts 6</a> below). Moreover, if verse <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.11">11</a> speaks of their wives (as I think it does), then it would also be likely that they were involved in some house-to-house visitation and counseling, because the wives are to be &ldquo;no slanderers.&rdquo; It would do no good for deacons if their wives (who would no doubt also be involved in prayer and counseling with the deacons) spread confidential matters around the church. But these are only suggestions of possible areas of responsibility hinted at in this passage.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The noun <span style="font-style:italic;">deacon</span> is not itself used in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.1-6">Acts 6:1&ndash;6</a>, but a related verb (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">διακονέω</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1354">G1354</a>) &ldquo;to serve&rdquo;) is found in verse <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.2">2</a>: &ldquo;It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to <span style="font-style:italic;">serve</span> tables.&rdquo; Here the apostles who ruled over the Jerusalem church found it necessary to delegate some administrative responsibilities to others. In this case, the responsibilities included the distribution of food to widows who were in need. It seems appropriate to think of these seven men as &ldquo;deacons&rdquo; even though the name <span style="font-style:italic;">deacon</span> had perhaps not yet come to be applied to them as they began this responsibility, for they seem to be given tasks which fit well with the responsibilities of deacons hinted at in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.8-12">1 Timothy 3:8&ndash;12</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There are other texts in which it is difficult to know whether the New Testament is speaking about a deacon as a special church officer or is simply using the word to refer to a &ldquo;servant&rdquo; in a general sense. This is the difficulty in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.1">Romans 16:1</a>, where Phoebe is called a &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or a &ldquo;deaconess&rdquo; or &ldquo;deacon&rdquo; (this type of Greek noun has the same form in both masculine and feminine genders, so it is simply a question of which English word is most appropriate) of the church at Cenchreae. Because Paul&rsquo;s requirement for deacons was that they be &ldquo;the husband of one wife&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.12">1 Tim. 3:12</a>), the translation &ldquo;servant&rdquo; seems preferable in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.1">Romans 16:1</a> (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">διάκονος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1356">G1356</a>) takes this sense in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro13.4">Rom. 13:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.8">15:8</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.5">1 Cor. 3:5</a>). In general, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 920  </span>the verses on deacons show that they had recognized offices to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; the church in various ways. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.1-6">Acts 6:1&ndash;6</a> suggests that they had some administrative responsibilities, but were nevertheless subject to the authority of those who had rule over the entire church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is significant that nowhere in the New Testament do deacons have ruling authority over the church as the elders do, nor are deacons ever required to be able to teach Scripture or sound doctrine.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Other Offices?</span> In many churches today, there are other offices, such as treasurer, moderator (one responsible for chairing church business meetings), or trustees (in some forms of church government, these are people who have legal accountability for the property owned by the church). Moreover, churches with more than one paid staff member may have some staff members (such as music director, education director, youth worker, etc.) who are &ldquo;publicly recognized as having the right and responsibility to perform certain functions in the church,&rdquo; and who thus fit our definition of church officer, and who may even be paid to perform such functions as a full-time occupation, but who may not be elders or deacons in the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There does not seem to be any reason to say that these should not be offices in the church as well, even though all of them could probably be put in the category of either elder or deacon (most of those mentioned above could be deacons with specific responsibilities, or the moderator could also be an elder who simply moderates church business meetings). Nevertheless, if these or other similar offices seem helpful for the functioning of the church, there seems to be no reason why they should not be established. Yet if they are established, it would be necessary to see that they not overshadow the importance of the offices specifically named in Scripture, and that they not have any authority that is not subject to the governing authority of those officers that are clearly named in Scripture. If significant influence or authority is gained by those who have offices not named in Scripture, then it is much less likely that people in the congregation or the office holders themselves will look to Scripture and find detailed descriptions of how they should act or how they should be chosen. This would tend to diminish the effective authority of Scripture to govern the church in the area of church leadership.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. How Should Church Officers Be Chosen?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the history of the church there have been two major types of process for the selection of church officers&mdash;selection by a higher authority, or selection by the local congregation. The Roman Catholic Church has its officers appointed by a higher authority: the Pope appoints cardinals and bishops, and the bishops appoint priests in local parishes. This is a &ldquo;hierarchy&rdquo; or system of government by a priesthood that is distinct from the lay people in the church. This system claims an unbroken line of descent from Christ and the apostles, and claims that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 921  </span>present priesthood stands as Christ&rsquo;s representatives in the church. Although the Church of England (the Episcopalian Church in the United States) does not submit to government by the Pope or have cardinals, it does have some similarities to the hierarchical system of the Roman Catholic Church, since it is governed by bishops and archbishops, and its clergy are thought of as priests. It also claims direct succession from the apostles, and priests and bishops are appointed by a higher authority outside the local parish.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In distinction from this system of appointment by higher authority, in most other Protestant groups church officers are chosen by the local church, or by some group within the local church, even though the form of church government may vary in other significant ways (see below). Since this is an area in which there is no absolutely decisive biblical text, we ought to be patient with some diversity among evangelicals on this issue. However, there are several reasons why it seems most appropriate that church officers (such as elder and deacon, and certainly including the &ldquo;pastor&rdquo;) should be chosen or at least affirmed or recognized in some way by the whole congregation:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(1) In the New Testament, there are several examples where church officers were apparently chosen by the whole congregation. In <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.3">Acts 6:3</a>, the apostles do not themselves pick out the seven early deacons (if we see them as deacons), but say to the whole church, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Pick out from among you</span> seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty.&rdquo; The initial selection of these men was done by the whole congregation. When a replacement was chosen for Judas to be numbered among the apostles, <span style="font-style:italic;">the whole congregation of 120 persons</span> (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.15">Acts 1:15</a>) made the initial selection of two, from whom the Lord himself indicated which one he would appoint: &ldquo;And <span style="font-style:italic;">they</span> put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.23">Acts 1:23</a>). At the end of the Jerusalem council, the whole church had a part with the apostles and elders in choosing representatives to convey the decisions to the other churches, for the choosing and sending was done by &ldquo;the apostles and elders, <span style="font-style:italic;">with the whole church</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.22">Acts 15:22</a>; cf. &ldquo;in assembly,&rdquo; v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.25">25</a>). Moreover, when some of the churches sent an offering with Paul to be taken to the Jerusalem church, the churches also sent a representative to accompany Paul, one who, according to Paul, &ldquo;has been appointed <span style="font-style:italic;">by the churches</span> to travel with us in this gracious work&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co8.19">2 Cor. 8:19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It may be objected that Paul and Barnabas &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">appointed</span>&rdquo; elders in every church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.23">Acts 14:23</a>), and Paul also told Titus to &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">appoint</span> elders in every town&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5">Titus 1:5</a>). Does this not seem more like the Roman Catholic or Anglican system than a system of congregational choice? Yet even those verses need not imply that the apostles alone made the selection, but could certainly include congregational consultation and even consent before an official appointment or installation was made (as with the appointment in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.3">Acts 6:3</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.6">6</a>). The word <span style="font-style:italic;">appoint</span> may also mean &ldquo;install.&rdquo;

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 922  </span>(2) Another reason for congregational participation in the selection of church officers is that in the New Testament generally, final governing authority seems to rest not with any group outside the church or any group within the church, but with the church as a whole. The final step in church discipline before excommunication is to &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">tell it to the church</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.17">Matt. 18:17</a>). Excommunication, or the act of excluding someone from the fellowship of the church, is done when the <span style="font-style:italic;">whole congregation</span> is &ldquo;assembled&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.4">1 Cor. 5:4</a>), and is therefore apparently done by the entire congregation. One other consideration that is suggestive, but not conclusive, is the fact that the epistles that are written to churches are not sent to the elders or some other group of leaders within the churches, but are all written to entire churches, and the whole congregation is encouraged to read and expected to give heed to these epistles (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.7">Rom. 1:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.2">1 Cor. 1:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co1.1">2 Cor. 1:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co1.13">2 Cor. 1:13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col4.16">Col. 4:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti4.13">1 Tim. 4:13</a>). This means that the apostles relate directly to the congregations, not to the congregations through the officers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There are also some practical reasons that can be mentioned:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(3) If the entire congregation selects the officers of the church, there is more accountability to the congregation. Paul assumed some level of accountability when he provided for the fact that &ldquo;two or three witnesses&rdquo; could bring a charge of wrongdoing against an elder (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.19">1 Tim. 5:19</a>). This accountability provides an additional safeguard against temptations to sin and excessive lust for power.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(4) Historically, false doctrine often seems to be adopted by the theologians of the church first, by the pastors second, and by the informed laity, who are daily reading their Bibles and walking with the Lord, last. Therefore, if the leadership begins to stray in doctrine or in life, and there is no election by the congregation, then the church as a whole has no practical means of getting hold of the situation and turning it around. But if officers are elected by the church, then there is a system of &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo; whereby even the governing authority of the church has some accountability to the church as a whole.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(5) Government works best when it has the consent of those governed (cf., in the Old Testament, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex4.29-31">Ex. 4:29&ndash;31</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa7.5-6">1 Sam. 7:5&ndash;6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa10.24">10:24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Sa2.4">2 Sam. 2:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki1.39-40">1 Kings 1:39&ndash;40</a>; and note the mistake of Rehoboam in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki12.1">1 Kings 12:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki12.15">15</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These factors combine to indicate that although Scripture does not explicitly command one specific system of choosing church officers, it would seem most wise to have a system whereby the entire church has a significant role in the selection and recognition of the officers of the church&mdash;perhaps through a congregational vote, or through some other process whereby congregational recognition is required before church officers can assume office.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 923  </span>Can anything else be said about the process of selecting officers? Some additional congregational checks against excessive use of authority might be built into the selection process. There is room for wide variation here, but provisions such as election to limited terms of office, a requirement for a mandatory year off (except for full-time pastoral staff members who are elders) every few years, a requirement for periodic reaffirmation of election, and a provision in the nominating process whereby nominations can be made by the members of the congregation (even if most nominations come from the elders themselves), would all provide additional measures of accountability to the congregation without forfeiting any essential aspects of governing authority over the congregation once elders are elected.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These factors would also provide some arguments against a self-perpetuating group of elders which is not subject to election or periodic reconfirmation by the congregation, but once again it must be said that no specific directives are listed in Scripture and there is room for variation at this point.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In discussing forms of church government there is some overlap with the previous section on the method of choosing church officers, for the selection of officers is one very important aspect of authority in the church. Different philosophies of church government will be reflected in different methods used for selecting officers of the church, as explained above.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is evident in the fact that forms of church government can be broken down into three large categories, which we may term &ldquo;episcopalian,&rdquo; &ldquo;presbyterian,&rdquo; and &ldquo;congregational.&rdquo; The <span style="font-style:italic;">episcopalian</span> forms have a government by a distinct category of church officers known as a priesthood, and final authority for decision-making is found outside the local church. The Episcopal Church system is the primary representative among Protestants of this form of government. The <span style="font-style:italic;">presbyterian</span> forms have a government by elders, some of whom have authority not only over their local congregation, but also, through the presbytery and the general assembly, over all the churches in a region and then in the denomination as a whole. The <span style="font-style:italic;">congregational</span> forms of church government all have final governing authority resting with the local congregation, although various degrees of self-rule are given up through denominational affiliation, and the actual form of local church government may vary considerably. We shall examine each of these forms of government in the following discussion.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Episcopalian</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the episcopalian system, an archbishop has authority over many bishops. They in turn have authority over a &ldquo;diocese,&rdquo; which simply means the churches under the jurisdiction of a bishop. The officer in charge of a local parish is a rector (or sometimes a vicar, who is an &ldquo;assistant&rdquo; or one who substitutes for the rector). Archbishops, bishops, and rectors are all priests, since they have all at one time <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 924  </span>been ordained to the episcopalian priesthood (but in practice the rector is most often called the priest).

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The argument for the episcopalian system is not that it is found in the New Testament, but that it is a natural outgrowth of the development of the church which began in the New Testament, and it is not forbidden by the New Testament. E.A. Litton writes, &ldquo;No order of Diocesan Bishops appears in the New Testament,&rdquo; but immediately adds:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The evidence is in favour of the supposition that Episcopacy sprang from the Church itself, and by a natural process, and that it was sanctioned by Saint John, the last survivor of the Apostles. The Presbytery, when it assembled for consultation, would naturally elect a president to maintain order; first temporarily, but in time with permanent authority … Thus it is probable that at an early period an informal episcopate had sprung up in each church. As the Apostles were one by one removed … the office would assume increased importance and become invested with greater powers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, since the office of bishop and the corresponding government structure found in the Episcopalian Church is both historical and beneficial, Litton argues that it should be preserved. Finally, the benefit of direct descent from the apostles is regarded as a strong reason in favor of the episcopalian system. Litton says, &ldquo;The Apostles are the first link in the chain, and there is no reason why a succession, as regards to the external commission, should not proceed from age to age, the existing body of ministers handing down the official authority to their successors, and these latter in turn to theirs.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But there are arguments that may be given on the other side of this question. (1) It is significant that the office of &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; is not a distinct office in the New Testament, but is simply a synonym for the name &ldquo;elder,&rdquo; as Litton himself agrees. There is no <span style="font-style:italic;">single</span> bishop in the New Testament, but bishops (or <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 925  </span>overseers) are always plural in number. This should not be seen merely as an incidental fact, for even among the apostles Jesus did not leave one with superior authority over the others, but left a group of twelve who were equal in governing authority (and to whom others were later added, such as Paul). Though some apostles, such as Peter, James, and Paul, had prominence among the group, they did not have any greater authority than the others, and even Peter was rebuked by Paul in Antioch (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.11">Gal. 2:11</a>). This may well reflect the wisdom of Christ in guarding against the abuse of power that inevitably comes when any one human being has too much power without sufficient checks and balances from others. Just as Jesus left a plurality of apostles to have ultimate (human) authority in the early church, so the apostles always appointed a plurality of elders in every church, never leaving only one person with governing authority.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(2) The theory of a group of bishops established to replace the apostles is not taught in the New Testament, nor is there an implication of a need for <span style="font-style:italic;">physical</span> continuity of ordination through the laying on of hands by those who have been ordained in an unbroken chain of succession from the apostles. For example, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.3">Acts 13:3</a>, it was not the Jerusalem apostles who ordained Paul and Barnabas, but people in the church at Antioch who laid hands on them and sent them out. In fact, there is very little evidence that the apostles had any concern for a line of succession. Timothy apparently was ordained not simply by Paul but also by a &ldquo;council of elders&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti4.14">1 Tim. 4:14</a>), though this may well have included Paul as well (see <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.6">2 Tim. 1:6</a>). More importantly, ordaining is ultimately from the Lord himself (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.28">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.28">1 Cor. 12:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.11">Eph. 4:11</a>), and there is nothing in the nature of &ldquo;ordaining&rdquo; (when it is simply seen as public recognition of an office) that requires that it be done <span style="font-style:italic;">only</span> by those previously ordained in <span style="font-style:italic;">physical</span> descent from the apostles. If God has called an elder, he is to be recognized, and no concern about physical descent needs to be raised. In addition, if one is convinced that the local church should elect elders (see discussion above), then it would seem appropriate that the church that elected the elder&mdash;not an external bishop&mdash;should be the group to confer the outward recognition at election by installing the person in office or ordaining the pastor.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(3) While it may be argued that the development of an episcopalian system with single bishops in authority over several churches was a beneficial development in the early church, one may also argue that it was a deviation from New Testament standards and a result of human dissatisfaction with the system of elected local elders that had been established by the apostles and that had apparently worked very well from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 30 to 100 throughout all of the New Testament church. But one&rsquo;s evaluation of the historical data will of course depend on one&rsquo;s evaluation of earlier arguments for and against an episcopalian system.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Presbyterian</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In this system, each local church elects elders to a session (E in figure <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.47.1.3.2.1.0%3aFIG.47.2">47.2</a> stands for elder, and the dotted lines indicate that the whole congregation elects the elders). The pastor of the church will be one of the elders <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 926  </span>in the session, equal in authority to the other elders. This session has governing authority over the local church. However, the members of the session (the elders) are also members of a presbytery, which has authority over several churches in a region. This presbytery consists of some or all of the elders in the local churches over which it has authority. Moreover, some of the members of the presbytery are members of the &ldquo;general assembly&rdquo; which usually will have authority over all the presbyterian churches in a nation or region.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The arguments in favor of this presbyterian system are: (1) that those who have wisdom and gifts for eldership should be called on to use their wisdom to govern more than just one local church, and (2) a national (or even worldwide) government of the church shows the unity of the body of Christ. Moreover (3) such a system is able to prevent an individual congregation from falling into doctrinal error much more effectively than any voluntary association of churches.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The presbyterian system outlined above has many adherents among evangelical Christians today, and it certainly works effectively in many cases. However, some objections can be brought against this system: (1) Nowhere in Scripture do <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> have regularly established authority over more than their own local church. The pattern is rather that elders are appointed in local churches and have authority over local churches. Against this claim the Jerusalem council in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15">Acts 15</a> is often mentioned, but we should notice that this council was held in Jerusalem because of the presence of the apostles. Apparently the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem, with the representatives from Antioch (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.2">Acts 15:2</a>), together sought God&rsquo;s wisdom on this matter. And there seems to have been some consultation with the whole church as well, for we read, at the conclusion of the discussion, &ldquo;Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, <span style="font-style:italic;">with the whole church</span> to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.22">Acts 15:22</a>). (If this narrative gives support to regional government by elders, it <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 927  </span>therefore also gives support to regional government by whole congregations!) This situation with the elders in Jerusalem is not a good pattern to defend a system whereby elders have authority over more than their local churches: the Jerusalem church did not send for all the elders in Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, and call a meeting of &ldquo;the Judean presbytery&rdquo; or a &ldquo;general assembly.&rdquo; Although the apostles in Jerusalem certainly had authority over all the churches, there is no indication that elders by themselves, even in the Jerusalem church, had any such authority. And certainly there is no New Testament pattern for elders exercising authority over any other than their own local churches.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(2) This system, in practice, results in much formal litigation, where doctrinal disputes are pursued year after year all the way to the level of the general assembly. One wonders if this should be characteristic of the church of Christ&mdash;perhaps so, but it seems to the present author to be a system that encourages such litigation far more than is necessary or edifying for the body of Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(3) The effective power in church government seems, in practice, to be too removed from the final control of the lay people in the church. Although Berkhof, who defends this system of government, affirms quite clearly that &ldquo;the power of the church resides <span style="font-style:italic;">primarily</span> in the governing body of the local church,&rdquo; he also admits that, &ldquo;the more general the assembly, the more remote it is from the people.&rdquo; Thus the system is very hard to turn around when it begins to go wrong since the lay persons who are not elders have no vote in the session or the presbytery or the general assembly, and the governing structure of the church is more removed from them than in other church government structures.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(4) Although in some cases it is true that a doctrinally sound denomination with a presbyterian system of government can keep a local church from going astray in its doctrine, in actuality very frequently the opposite has been true: the national leadership of a presbyterian denomination has adopted false doctrine and has put great pressure on local churches to conform to it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(5) Although the presbyterian system does represent in one form the national or even worldwide unity of Christ&rsquo;s church, such unity can certainly be shown in other ways than through this system of government. The churches with more purely congregational forms of government do have voluntary associations that manifest this unity. In fact, these associations involve <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> the people in the churches, not just the elders or the clergy, as in a presbyterian system. The national meeting of a Baptist denomination, for example, where large numbers of ministers and lay persons (who are not necessarily elders or deacons, but just delegates from their churches) join together in fellowship might be seen as a better demonstration of the unity of Christ&rsquo;s body than a presbyterian general assembly where only elders are present.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this system, the congregation elects the pastor and also elects the deacons. The amount of authority the pastor has varies greatly from church to church, and will generally increase the longer a pastor remains in a church. The authority of the deacon board is often thought to be merely an advisory authority. In the way this system ordinarily functions, especially in smaller churches, many decisions must be brought before the congregation as a whole.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The arguments in favor of this system are clearly presented in A.H. Strong&rsquo;s <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/strongst?pos=*CONTENTS*"><span style="font-style:italic;">Systematic Theology</span></a> a text that has been widely used in Baptist circles. Strong gives the following arguments:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(1) The New Testament does not require a plurality of elders, but the pattern of plural elders seen in the New Testament was only due to the size of the churches at that time. He says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In certain of the New Testament churches there appears to have been a plurality of elders … There is, however, no evidence that the number of elders was uniform, or that the plurality which frequently existed was due to any other cause than the size of the churches for which these elders cared. The New Testament example, while it permits the multiplication of assistant pastors according to need, does not require a plural eldership in every case.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this quotation Strong shows that he would regard additional pastors hired by a larger church to be elders as well, so that this system could be expanded beyond a single elder/pastor to include two or more elder/pastors. But the crucial distinction is that <span style="font-style:italic;">the governing authority of the office of elder is possessed only by the professional </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 929  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">pastor(s) of the church</span> and is not shared by any lay persons in the church. And we must realize that in practice, the vast majority of churches that follow this pattern today are relatively small churches with only one pastor; therefore, in actuality, this usually becomes a single elder form of government.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(2) Strong adds that &ldquo;James was the pastor or president of the church at Jerusalem,&rdquo; and cites <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.17">Acts 12:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac21.18">21:18</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.12">Galatians 2:12</a> to show that this leadership by James was a pattern which could then be imitated by other churches.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(3) Strong notes that some passages have &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; in the singular but &ldquo;deacons&rdquo; in the plural, hinting at something similar to this common Baptist form of government. A literal translation of the Greek text shows a singular definite article modifying &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; in two verses: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The bishop</span> therefore must be without reproach&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Tim. 3:2</a>, literal translation) and that &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the bishop</span> must be blameless&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.7">Titus 1:7</a>, literal translation), but by contrast, we read, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Deacons</span> likewise must be serious …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.8">1 Tim. 3:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(4) Finally, the &ldquo;angel of the church&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.1">Revelation 2:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.8">8</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.12">12</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.18">18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.1">3:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.7">7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.14">14</a>, according to Strong, &ldquo;is best interpreted as meaning the pastor of the church; and, if this be correct, it is clear that each church had, not many pastors, but one.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(5) Another argument, not made by Strong, is found in recent literature on church growth. The argument is that churches need a strong single pastor in order to grow rapidly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Once again it must be said that this single elder form of government has also worked very successfully in many evangelical churches. However, there can be objections to the case presented by Strong and others.
	</p>

		(1) It seems inconsistent to argue that the New Testament falls short of giving a clear <span style="font-style:italic;">command</span> that all churches should have a plurality of elders when the passages on qualifications of elders in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.1-7">1 Timothy 3:1&ndash;7</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5-7">Titus 1:5&ndash;7</a> are used as scriptural <span style="font-style:italic;">requirements</span> for church officers today. How can churches say that the <span style="font-style:italic;">qualifications for elders</span> found in these verses are commanded for us today but the <span style="font-style:italic;">system of plural elders</span> found in these very same verses is not commanded, but was required only in that time and in that society? Though it could be objected that these are commands written only to individual situations in Ephesus and Crete, much of the New Testament consists of apostolic commands written to individual churches on how they should conduct themselves. Yet we do not therefore say that we are free to disobey these instructions in other parts of the epistles. In fact, 1 Timothy and Titus give us a great deal of material on the conduct of the local church, material which all believing churches seek to follow.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, it seems to be quite unwise to ignore a clear New Testament pattern <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 930  </span>which existed throughout all the churches for which we have evidence at the time the New Testament was written. When the New Testament shows us that <span style="font-style:italic;">no</span> church was seen to have a single elder (&ldquo;in <span style="font-style:italic;">every</span> church,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.23">Acts 14:23</a>; &ldquo;in every town,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5">Titus 1:5</a>; &ldquo;let him call for the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders,</span>&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.14">James 5:14</a>; &ldquo;I exhort the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> among you,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.1">1 Peter 5:1</a>), then it seems unpersuasive to say that smaller churches would have only had one elder. Even when Paul had just founded churches on his first missionary journey, there were <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> appointed &ldquo;in every church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.23">Acts 14:23</a>). And &ldquo;every town&rdquo; on the island of Crete was to have elders, no matter how large or small the church was.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition, there is an inconsistency in Strong&rsquo;s argument when he says that the large churches were those which had plural elders, for then he claims that &ldquo;the angel of the church in Ephesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.1">Rev. 2:1</a>) was a single pastor, according to this common Baptist pattern. Yet the church at Ephesus at that time was exceptionally large: Paul, in founding that church, had spent three years there (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.31">Acts 20:31</a>), during which time &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord</span> both Jews and Greeks&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac19.10">Acts 19:10</a>). The population of Ephesus at that time was more than 250,000.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may ask, why should we follow Strong and adopt as the norm a pattern of church government which is <span style="font-style:italic;">nowhere</span> found in the New Testament, and reject a pattern <span style="font-style:italic;">everywhere</span> found in the New Testament?

		(2) James may well have acted as moderator or presiding officer in the church in Jerusalem, for all churches will have some kind of designated leader like this in order to conduct meetings. But this does not imply that he was the &ldquo;pastor&rdquo; of the church in Jerusalem in a &ldquo;single elder&rdquo; sense. In fact, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.2">Acts 15:2</a> shows that there were <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> (plural) in the church in Jerusalem, and James himself was probably numbered among the apostles (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.19">Gal. 1:19</a>) rather than the elders.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(3) In <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Timothy 3:2</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.7">Titus 1:7</a>, the Greek definite article modifying &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; simply shows that Paul is speaking of general qualifications as they applied to any one example. In fact, in both cases which Strong cites we know there were <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> (plural) in the churches involved. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Timothy 3:2</a> is written to Timothy at Ephesus, and <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.17">Acts 20:17</a> shows us that there were &ldquo;elders&rdquo; in the church at Ephesus. And even in 1 Timothy, Paul writes, &ldquo;Let the <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.17">1 Tim. 5:17</a>). With regard to <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.7">Titus 1:7</a> we need only look to verse <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5">5</a>, where Paul directs Titus explicitly to &ldquo;appoint <span style="font-style:italic;">elders</span> in every town.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(4) The angels of the seven churches in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2-3">Revelation 2&ndash;3</a> are unusual and rather weak evidence for single elders. &ldquo;The angel of the church in Ephesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.1">Rev. 2:1</a>) can hardly mean that there was only one elder in that church, since we know there were &ldquo;elders&rdquo; there in this very large church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.17">Acts 20:17</a>). The word &ldquo;angel&rdquo; used in the address to the seven churches in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2-3">Revelation 2&ndash;3</a> may simply designate a <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 931  </span>special messenger to each church, perhaps even the human messenger who would take what John wrote to each church, or it may represent &ldquo;the prevailing spirit of the church&rdquo; rather than the ruling official of the congregation, or may even simply refer to an angel who was given special care over each congregation. Even if it did represent a presiding officer of some sort in each congregation, this &ldquo;angel&rdquo; is not shown to have any ruling authority or any functions equivalent to today&rsquo;s single pastor, or any functions equivalent to that of &ldquo;elder&rdquo; in the New Testament churches. This passage does not furnish strong enough evidence to dislodge the clear data throughout the New Testament showing plural elders in every church, even in the church in Ephesus.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is interesting that all of the New Testament passages cited by Strong (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15">Acts 15</a>, Jerusalem; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Tim. 3:2</a>, Ephesus; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.7">Titus 1:7</a>, Crete; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2-3">Rev. 2&ndash;3</a>, the seven churches, including Ephesus) speak of situations in which the New Testament itself points quite clearly to a plurality of elders in authority in the churches mentioned.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(5) The argument from church growth studies does not really prove that government led by a single pastor is necessary, for at least three reasons: (a) We should not reject a pattern supported in Scripture and adopt a different one just because people tell us that the different pattern seems to work well in producing large churches&mdash;our role here, as in all of life, should rather be to obey Scripture as closely as we can and expect God to bring appropriate blessing as he wills. (b) There are many large churches with government by plural elders (both Presbyterian churches and independent churches), so the argument from pragmatic considerations is not conclusive. (c) C. Peter Wagner admits that strong leaders can be found in various forms of church government, and we must agree that a system of plural elders in which all have equal authority does not prevent one elder (such as the pastor) from functioning as a sort of &ldquo;first among equals&rdquo; and having a significant leadership role among those elders.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(6) A common practical problem with a &ldquo;single elder&rdquo; system is either an excessive concentration of power in one person or excessive demands laid upon him. In either case, the temptations to sin are very great, and a lessened degree of accountability makes yielding to temptation more likely. As was mentioned above, it was never the pattern in the New Testament, even with the apostles, to concentrate ruling power in the hands of any one person.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here it should be noted that the &ldquo;single elder&rdquo; view of church government really has no more New Testament support than the &ldquo;single bishop&rdquo; (episcopalian) view. Both seem to be attempts to justify what has already happened in the history of the church, not conclusions that have grown out of an inductive examination of the New Testament itself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(7) Finally, it should be noted that in actual practice the &ldquo;single elder&rdquo; system can change and <span style="font-style:italic;">function</span> more like a &ldquo;plural elders&rdquo; government, only those who function as elders are instead called &ldquo;deacons.&rdquo; This would happen if the deacons share the actual governing authority with the pastor, and the pastor and other <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 932  </span>deacons see themselves as accountable to the deacon board as a whole. The system then begins to look like figure <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.47.1.3.3.1.2%3aFIG.47.4">47.4</a>.

		The problem with this arrangement is that it does not use biblical terminology to apply to the functions that people are carrying out, for &ldquo;deacons&rdquo; in the New Testament never had governing or teaching authority in the church. The result in such a situation is that people in the church (both the deacons and the other church members) will fail to read and apply scriptural passages on elders to those who are <span style="font-style:italic;">in fact functioning as elders</span> in their church. Therefore these passages lose the direct relevance that they should have in the church. In this case however, the problem could be solved by changing the name &ldquo;deacon&rdquo; to &ldquo;elder,&rdquo; and considering the pastor an elder along with the others.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Plural Local Elders</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Is there any kind of church government that preserves the pattern of plural elders found in the New Testament and that avoids the expansion of elders&rsquo; authority beyond the local congregation? Although such a system is not distinctive of any denomination today, it is found in many individual congregations. Using the conclusions reached to this point on the New Testament data, I would suggest figure <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.47.1.3.3.2.1%3aFIG.47.5">47.5</a> as a possible pattern.

		Within such a system the elders govern the church and have authority to rule <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 933  </span>over it, authority which has been conferred by Christ himself, the head of the church, and by the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.28">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.17">Heb. 13:17</a>). In this system of government, there is always more than one elder, a fact which distinguishes this form of government from the &ldquo;single elder system&rdquo; discussed above. In a contemporary congregation, the &ldquo;pastor&rdquo; (or &ldquo;senior pastor&rdquo;) would be one among the elders in this system. He does not have authority over them, nor does he work for them as an employee. He has a somewhat distinct role in that he is engaged in the full-time work of &ldquo;preaching and teaching&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.17">1 Tim. 5:17</a>), and derives part or all of his income from that work (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.18">1 Tim. 5:18</a>). He also may frequently assume a leadership role (such as chairman) among the elders, which would fit with his leadership role among the congregation, but such a leadership role <span style="font-style:italic;">among the elders</span> would not be necessary to the system. In addition, the pastor will ordinarily have considerable authority to make decisions and provide leadership in many areas of responsibility that have been delegated to him by the elder board as a whole. Such a system would allow a pastor to exercise strong leadership in the church while still having equal governing authority with the other elders.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The strength of this system of government is seen in the fact that the pastor does not have authority on his own over the congregation, but that authority belongs collectively to the entire group of elders (what may be called the elder board). Moreover, the pastor himself, like every other elder, is subject to the authority of the elder board as a whole. This can be a great benefit in keeping a pastor from making mistakes, and in supporting him in adversity and protecting him from attacks and opposition.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In such a system, are there limitations that should be placed on the authority of the elders? In the section above on the manner of choosing church officers, several reasons were given to have some &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo; that would put restrictions on the authority of the officers of a church. Those arguments are also helpful here in indicating that, though elders have substantial governing authority over the church, it should not be unlimited authority. Examples of such limitations might be suggested, such as: (1) they may be elected rather than self-perpetuating; <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 934  </span>(2) they may have specific terms with a mandatory year off the board (except for the pastor, whose continuing leadership responsibilities require continuous participation as an elder); (3) some large decisions may be required to be brought to the whole church for approval. Regarding this third point, congregational approval is already a biblical requirement for church discipline in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.17">Matthew 18:17</a> and for excommunication in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.4">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>. The principle of congregational election of elders would imply that the decision to call any pastor would also have to be approved by the congregation as a whole. Major new directions in the ministry of the church, which will require large-scale congregational support, may be brought to the church as a whole for approval. Finally, it would seem wise to require congregational approval on such large financial decisions as an annual budget, the decision to purchase property, or the decision to borrow money for the church (if that is ever done), simply because the church as a whole will be asked to give generously to pay for these commitments.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, the reasons for placing some limitations on the authority of church officers may appear so strong that they would lead us to think that all decisions and all governing authority should rest with the congregation as a whole. (Some churches have adopted a system of almost pure democracy in governing the church, whereby everything must come to the congregation as a whole for approval.) However, this conclusion ignores the abundant New Testament evidence about the clear ruling and governing authority given to elders in New Testament churches. Therefore, while it is important to have <span style="font-style:italic;">some recognized checks</span> on the authority of elders, and to rest ultimate governing authority with the congregation as a whole, it still is necessary, if we are to remain faithful to the New Testament pattern, to have a strong level of authority vested in the elders themselves.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		I have labeled this system one of &ldquo;plural <span style="font-style:italic;">local</span> elders&rdquo; in order to distinguish it from a presbyterian system where elders, when gathered on the level of the presbytery or general assembly, have authority over more than their own local congregations. But in such a system of elected local elders, can there be any wider associations with churches beyond the local congregation? Yes, certainly. While <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 935  </span>churches with this system may choose to remain entirely independent, most will enter into voluntary associations with other churches of similar convictions in order to facilitate fellowship, pooling of resources for mission activity (and perhaps for other things such as Christian camps, publications, theological education, etc.). However, the only authority these larger associations would have over the local congregation would be the authority to exclude an individual church from the association, not the authority to govern its individual affairs.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. Corporate Board</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The remaining three forms of congregational church government are not commonly used, but are sometimes found in evangelical churches. The first one is patterned after the example of a modern corporation, where the board of directors hires an executive officer who then has authority to run the business as he sees fit. This form of government could also be called the &ldquo;you-work-for-us&rdquo; structure.

		In favor of this structure it might be argued that this system in fact works well in contemporary businesses. However, there is no New Testament precedent or support for such a form of church government. It is simply the result of trying to run the church like a modern business, and it sees the pastor not as a spiritual leader, but merely as a paid employee.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Further objections to this structure are the fact that it deprives the pastor of sharing in the ruling authority that must be his if he is to carry out his eldership responsibilities effectively. Moreover, the members of the board are also members of the congregation over whom the pastor is supposed to have some authority, but that authority is seriously compromised if the leaders of the congregation are in fact his bosses.

		In this case, the church would deny that any form of government is needed, it would depend on all the members of the congregation being sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit in their own lives, and decisions would generally be made by consensus. This form of government never lasts very long. Not only is it unfaithful to the New Testament pattern of designated elders with governing authority in the church, but it is also subject to much abuse, because subjective feelings rather than wisdom and reason prevail in the decision-making process.

Moreover, a number of different types of church government systems seem to work <span style="font-style:italic;">fairly well</span>.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Most systematic theologies have not included a section on the question of whether women can be church officers, because it has been assumed through the history of the church, with very few exceptions, that only men could be pastors or function as elders within a church. But in recent years a major controversy has arisen within the evangelical world: may women as well as men be pastors? May they share in all the offices of the church? I have treated this question much more extensively elsewhere but a brief summary of the question can be given at this point.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We must affirm at the outset that the creation narrative in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.27"><span style="font-style:italic;">Genesis 1:27</span></a><span style="font-style:italic;"> views men and women as equally created in the image of God</span>. Therefore, men and women have equal value to God, and should be seen by us as having absolutely equal value as persons, and equal value to the church. Moreover, Scripture assures men and women of equal access to all the blessings of salvation (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.17-18">Acts 2:17&ndash;18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.28">Gal. 3:28</a>). This is remarkably affirmed in the high dignity and respect which Jesus accorded to women in his earthly ministry.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We must also admit that evangelical churches have often failed to recognize the full equality of men and women, and thereby have failed to count women equal in value to men. The result has been a tragic failure to recognize that God often gives women equal or greater spiritual gifts than men, a failure to encourage women to have full and free participation in the various ministries of the church, and a failure to take full account of the wisdom that God has given to women with respect to important decisions in the life of the church. If the present controversy over women&rsquo;s roles in the church can result in the eradication of some of these past abuses, then the church as a whole will benefit greatly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet the question remains, should women be pastors or elders in churches? (Or should they fill roles equivalent to that of an elder in churches that have alternative forms of government?) My own conclusion on this issue is that the Bible does not permit women to function in the role of pastor or elder within a church. This has also been the conclusion of the vast majority of churches in various societies throughout history. The reasons that seem to me to be most persuasive in answering this question are the following:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.11-14"><span style="font-weight:bold;">1 Timothy 2:11&ndash;14</span></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The single passage in Scripture that addresses this question most directly is <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.11-14">1 Timothy 2:11&ndash;14</a>:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 938  </span>Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. <span style="font-style:italic;">I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men;</span> she is to keep silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here Paul is speaking about the church when it is assembled (see vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.8-9">8&ndash;9</a>). In such a setting, Paul says, &ldquo;I permit no woman to <span style="font-style:italic;">teach</span> or to <span style="font-style:italic;">have authority</span> over men&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.12">12</a>). These are the functions that are carried out by the elders of the church, and especially by what we know as a pastor in contemporary church situations. It is specifically these functions unique to elders that Paul prohibits for women in the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Several objections have been brought against this position:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(a) It has been said that this passage applies only to a specific situation that Paul is addressing, probably one where women were teaching heretical doctrine within the church at Ephesus. But this objection is not persuasive, since there is no clear statement in 1 Timothy that says that women were actually <span style="font-style:italic;">teaching</span> false doctrines. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.13">1 Tim. 5:13</a> talks about women who are gossiping, but does not mention false doctrine.) Moreover, Paul does not simply tell certain women who are teaching false doctrine to be silent, but he says, &ldquo;I permit no <span style="font-style:italic;">woman</span> to teach or to have authority over men.&rdquo; And finally, the <span style="font-style:italic;">reason</span> Paul gives for this prohibition is not the one proposed in this objection, but a far different one: the situation of Adam and Eve before the fall, and before there was any sin in the world (see v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.13">13</a>), and the way in which a reversal in male and female roles occurred at the time of the fall (see v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.14">14</a>). These reasons are not limited to one situation in the church at Ephesus, but have application to manhood and womanhood generally.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(b) Another objection is to say that Paul gave this prohibition because women were not well educated in the first century, and therefore were not qualified for teaching or governing roles in the church. But Paul does not give lack of education as a reason for saying that women cannot &ldquo;teach or … have authority over men,&rdquo; but rather points back to creation (vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.13-14">13&ndash;14</a>). It is precarious to base an argument on a reason Paul did <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> give instead of the reason he <span style="font-style:italic;">did</span> give.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition, this objection misunderstands the actual facts of the ancient church and the ancient world. Formal training in Scripture was not required for church leadership in the New Testament church, because several of the apostles did not have formal biblical training (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.13">Acts 4:13</a>). On the other hand, the skills of basic literacy and therefore the ability to read and study Scripture were available to men and women alike (note <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.26">Acts 18:26</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.1">Rom. 16:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.11">1 Tim. 2:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt2.3-4">Titus 2:3&ndash;4</a>). There were many well-educated women in the ancient world, and particularly in a cultural center such as Ephesus.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, those who make such an argument are sometimes inconsistent in that elsewhere they point to women who had leadership positions in the ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 939  </span>church, such as Priscilla. This point is especially relevant to <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2">1 Timothy 2</a>, because Paul was writing to Ephesus (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti1.3">1 Tim. 1:3</a>), which was the home church of Priscilla and Aquila (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.18-19">Acts 18:18&ndash;19</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.21">21</a>). It was in this very church at Ephesus that Priscilla knew Scripture well enough to help instruct Apollos in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 51 (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.26">Acts 18:26</a>). Then she had probably learned from Paul himself for another three years while he stayed at Ephesus teaching &ldquo;the whole counsel of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.27">Acts 20:27</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.31">31</a>; also <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co16.19">1 Cor. 16:19</a>). No doubt many other women in Ephesus had followed her example and also had learned from Paul. Although they later went to Rome, we find Aquila and Priscilla back in Ephesus at the end of Paul&rsquo;s life (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti4.19">2 Tim. 4:19</a>), about <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 67 Therefore, it is likely that they were in Ephesus in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 65, about the time Paul wrote 1 Timothy (about <span style="font-style:italic;">fourteen years after Priscilla had helped instruct Apollos</span>). Yet Paul does not allow even well-educated Priscilla or any other well-educated women at Ephesus to teach men in the public assembly of the church. The reason was not lack of education, but the order of creation which God established between men and women.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. </span><a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.33b-36"><span style="font-weight:bold;">1 Corinthians 14:33b&ndash;36</span></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In a similar teaching, Paul says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As in all the churches of the saints, the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. What! Did the word of God originate with you, or are you the only ones it has reached? (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.33b-36">1 Cor. 14:33b&ndash;36</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this section Paul cannot be prohibiting all public speech by women in the church, for he clearly allows them to pray and prophesy in church in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.5">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>. Therefore, it is best to understand this passage as referring to speech that is in the category being discussed in the immediate context, namely, the spoken evaluation and judging of prophecies in the congregation (see v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.29">29</a>: &ldquo;Let two or three prophets speak, and <span style="font-style:italic;">let the others weigh what is said</span>&rdquo;). While Paul allows women to speak and give prophecies in the church meeting, he does not allow them to speak up and give evaluations or critiques of the prophecies that have been given, for this would be a ruling or governing function with respect to the whole church. This understanding of the passage depends on our view of the gift of prophecy in the New Testament age, namely, that prophecy involves not authoritative Bible teaching, and not speaking words of God which are equal to Scripture, but rather reporting something which God spontaneously brings to mind. In this way, Paul&rsquo;s teachings are quite consistent in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14">1 Corinthians 14</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2">1 Timothy 2</a>: in both cases he is concerned to preserve male leadership in the teaching and governing of the church.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 940  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">3. </span><a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.1-7"><span style="font-weight:bold;">1 Timothy 3:1&ndash;7</span></a><span style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5-9"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Titus 1:5&ndash;9</span></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Both <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.1-7">1 Timothy 3:1&ndash;7</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.5-9">Titus 1:5&ndash;9</a> assume that elders are going to be men. An elder (or bishop/overseer) must be &ldquo;the husband of one wife&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.2">1 Tim. 3:2</a>; also <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.6">Titus 1:6</a>), and &ldquo;must manage his own household well, keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.4">1 Tim. 3:4</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some may object that these were directions given only for the cultural situation in the ancient world, where women were not well educated, but the same response that was given above concerning <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2">1 Timothy 2</a> would apply in this case as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. The Relationship Between the Family and the Church</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The New Testament makes frequent connections between the life of the family and the life of the church. Paul says, &ldquo;If a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for God&rsquo;s church?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.5">1 Tim. 3:5</a>). He says to Timothy, &ldquo;Do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as you would a <span style="font-style:italic;">father;</span> treat younger men like <span style="font-style:italic;">brothers</span> older women like <span style="font-style:italic;">mothers</span> younger women like <span style="font-style:italic;">sisters</span> in all purity&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.1-2">1 Tim. 5:1&ndash;2</a>). Several other passages could be cited, but the close relationship between the family and the church should be clear.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because of this connection, it is inevitable that leadership patterns in the family will reflect leadership patterns in the church, and vice versa. It is very appropriate that, as godly men fulfill their leadership responsibilities in the family, they should also fulfill leadership responsibilities in the church. Conversely, if patterns of female leadership are established in the church, it will inevitably bring pressures toward greater female leadership, and toward abdication of male leadership, within the family.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. The Example of the Apostles</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> While the apostles are not the same as elders in local churches, it is still important to realize that Jesus established a pattern of male leadership in the church when he appointed twelve men as apostles. It is simply not true that women have equal access to all offices in the church, for Jesus, the head of the church, is a man. And the twelve apostles who will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt19.28">Matt. 19:28</a>), and whose names are written forever on the foundations of the heavenly city (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.14">Rev. 21:14</a>), are all men. Therefore, <span style="font-style:italic;">there will be no eternal modeling of equal roles for men and women at all levels of authority in the church</span>. Rather, there is a pattern of male leadership in the highest governing roles of the church, a pattern that will be evident to all believers for all eternity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One objection brought against this argument is the claim that the culture at that time would not have allowed Jesus to choose six men and six women as apostles, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 941  </span>or six husband-wife teams as apostles, and this is the reason he did not do so. But such an objection impugns Jesus&rsquo; integrity and courage. Jesus was not afraid to break social customs when a moral principle was at stake: he criticized the Pharisees publicly, healed on the Sabbath, cleansed the temple, spoke with a Samaritan woman, ate with tax collectors and sinners, and ate with unwashed hands. If Jesus had wanted to establish a principle of equal access to church leadership by both men and women, he certainly could have done so in the appointment of his apostles, and he would have done so, in spite of cultural opposition, if it had been the pattern he wanted to establish in his church. But he did not.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another objection to this argument is to say that, if this is true, then only Jews can be leaders in our churches, since all twelve apostles were Jewish as well. But this objection is not persuasive because it fails to recognize that the church was entirely Jewish at its beginning. This was because it was God&rsquo;s plan to bring salvation through the Jews, and this led to twelve Jewish apostles. Yet within the pages of the New Testament, we see that the church soon expanded to include Gentiles (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.19">Matt. 28:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.16">Eph. 2:16</a>) and Gentiles soon became elders and leaders in the New Testament church. A Gentile (Luke) wrote two books of the New Testament (Luke and Acts), and several Gentiles such as Titus and Epaphroditus were Paul&rsquo;s apostolic assistants and co-workers. In fact, God had progressively revealed from the time of Abraham (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge12.3">Gen. 12:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge17.5">17:5</a>) that it was his plan eventually to include countless Gentiles among his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So the Jewishness of the early apostles is not like their maleness. The church began as entirely Jewish, but soon became Jewish and Gentile as well. But the church did not begin all male, and only later include females as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">Christ&rsquo;s followers were male and female from the beginning</span> and both men and women were present at the beginning of the church at Pentecost. So this objection is not persuasive either.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. The History of Male Teaching and Leadership Through the Whole Bible</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Sometimes opponents of the view presented here have said it is based only on one text, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2">1 Timothy 2</a>. Several of the foregoing arguments have demonstrated that this is not the case, but there is one further argument that can be made: throughout the history of the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, there is a consistent pattern of male leadership among God&rsquo;s people. Though there are occasional examples of women having leadership in government positions such as queen (Athaliah did reign as sole monarch in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki11.1-20">2 Kings 11:1&ndash;20</a>, but she is hardly an example to imitate) or judge (note Deborah in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jdg4-5">Judg. 4&ndash;5</a>), and though there were occasionally women such as Deborah and Huldah who were prophetesses (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jdg4-5">Judg. 4&ndash;5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki22.14-20">2 Kings 22:14&ndash;20</a>), we should note that these are rare exceptions in unusual circumstances. They occur in the midst of an overwhelming pattern of male leadership in teaching and governance, and, as such, they hardly serve as patterns for New Testament church office. Moreover, <span style="font-style:italic;">there is not one </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 942  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">example in the entire Bible of a woman doing the kind of congregational Bible teaching that is expected of pastors/elders in the New Testament church</span>. In the Old Testament it was the priests who had teaching responsibilities for the people, and the priesthood was exclusively male; moreover, even the women prophets Deborah and Huldah prophesied only privately, not publicly to a congregation of people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">7. The History of the Church</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> As was mentioned above, the overwhelming pattern through the entire history of the church has been that the office of pastor/elder (or its equivalent) has been reserved for men. Although this does not demonstrate conclusively that such a position is correct, it should give us reason to reflect very seriously on the question before we rush ahead and declare that almost the entire church throughout its history has been wrong on this issue.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">8. Objections</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Numerous objections have been brought against the position outlined here, only a few of which can be treated at this point. It is objected that <span style="font-style:italic;">ministry should be determined by gifts, not by gender</span>. But in response, it must be said that spiritual gifts have to be used within the guidelines given in Scripture. The Holy Spirit who empowers spiritual gifts is also the Holy Spirit who inspired the Bible, and he does not want us to use his gifts in disobedience to his words.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another objection is to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">if God has genuinely called a woman to be a pastor, she should not be prevented from acting as one</span>. The response to this objection is similar to the one given above: an individual claim to have experienced a call from God must always be tested by subjecting it to the words of God in Scripture. If the Bible teaches that God wills for men alone to bear the primary teaching and governing responsibilities of the pastorate, then by implication the Bible also teaches that God does not call women to be pastors. However, we should add that often what a woman discerns as a divine call to the pastorate may be indeed a call to full-time Christian ministry, but not to be a pastor/elder in a church. In fact, many opportunities for full-time occupational ministry exist within the local church and elsewhere, apart from being a teaching pastor or an elder&mdash;for example, church staff positions in counseling, women&rsquo;s ministries, Christian <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 943  </span>education, and children&rsquo;s ministries, as well as ministries of music and worship, campus student ministries, evangelistic ministries, ministries to the poor, and administrative responsibilities that do not involve functioning in the elder&rsquo;s role of government over the entire church. This list could be expanded, but the point is that we should not make restrictions where Scripture itself does not place restrictions, but should allow and encourage full and free participation by women as well as men in all of these other areas.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some object that <span style="font-style:italic;">the New Testament emphasis is on servant leadership</span> and therefore that we should not be so concerned about authority, since that is more a pagan than a Christian concern. But this objection makes a false distinction between servanthood and authority. Certainly Jesus himself is the model of a servant leader, but Jesus also has authority&mdash;great authority! He is the Lord of our lives and the Lord of the church. By analogy, elders ought to follow Jesus&rsquo; example of servant leadership (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.1-5">1 Peter 5:1&ndash;5</a>) but that does not mean that they should neglect to govern with authority when the Bible itself gives them this responsibility (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.17">1 Tim. 5:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.17">Heb. 13:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.5">1 Peter 5:5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Sometimes people object that, <span style="font-style:italic;">just as the church finally realized that slavery was wrong, so the church today should recognize that male leadership is wrong</span> and is an outdated cultural tradition that should be discarded. But this objection fails to realize the difference between the temporary cultural institution of slavery, which God certainly did not establish at creation, and the existence of a difference in male-female roles in marriage (and, by implication, in relationships within the church) which God established at creation. The seeds for the destruction of slavery were sown in the New Testament (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Phm16">Philem. 16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.9">Eph. 6:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col4.1">Col. 4:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti6.1-2">1 Tim. 6:1&ndash;2</a>), but no seeds for the destruction of marriage, or the destruction of male-female differences as created, are sown in the Bible. Moreover, the objection can be turned around: it is likely that a closer parallel to the Christian defenders of slavery in the nineteenth century is found in evangelical feminists who today use arguments from the Bible to justify conformity to some extremely strong pressures in contemporary society (in favor of slavery then, and women being pastors now).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is sometimes objected that <span style="font-style:italic;">Priscilla and Aquila together spoke to Apollos</span> and &ldquo;expounded to him the way of God more accurately&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.26">Acts 18:26</a>). This is true, and it is helpful evidence showing that informal discussion of Scripture by men and women together, in which both men and women play a significant role in helping one another understand Scripture, is approved by the New Testament. Once again, an example such as this cautions us not to prohibit activities which are not prohibited by Scripture, yet it does not overturn the principle that the publicly recognized governing and teaching role within a church is restricted to men. Priscilla was not doing anything contrary to this restriction.

		Sometimes it is objected that <span style="font-style:italic;">it is inconsistent to allow women to vote in churches that have congregational government, but not to serve as elders</span>. But the authority of the church as a whole is not the same as the authority given to specific individuals within the church. When we say that the congregation as a whole has authority, we do not mean that each man and each woman in the congregation has the authority to speak or act for the congregation. Therefore, gender, as a part of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 944  </span>individual personhood, is not significantly in view in corporate congregational decisions.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another way of putting this is to say that the only question we are asking in this section is whether women can be officers within the church, and specifically whether they can be elders within the church. In any congregational system where the elders are elected by the congregation, it is evident to everyone in the church that the elders have a kind of delegated authority which other members of the congregation do not have&mdash;even though the other members of the congregation have voted for these people in the first place. It is the same in all systems of government where officials are elected: once the President of the United States or the mayor of a city is elected, that person has a delegated authority over the people who elected him or her and it is an authority that is greater than the authority of any individual person who voted.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At this point it is also appropriate to recognize that God has given much insight and wisdom to women as well as to men, and that any church leaders who neglect to draw on the wisdom that women have are really acting foolishly. Therefore, any group of elders or other male leaders who make decisions affecting the entire church should frequently have procedures within the church whereby the wisdom and insight of other members of the church, especially the wisdom and insight of women as well as men, can be drawn upon as an aid in making decisions.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">9. What About Other Offices Within the Church?</span> The entire discussion above has focused on the question of whether women should function as pastors or elders within the church. But what about other offices?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The biblical teaching regarding the office of <span style="font-style:italic;">deacon</span> is much less extensive than that regarding the office of elder, and what is involved in the office of deacon varies considerably from church to church. If deacons are actually functioning as elders and have the highest governing authority within a local church, then the arguments given above against women being elders would apply directly to this situation, and it would follow that Scripture does not permit women to be deacons in this sense. On the other hand, if deacons simply have delegated administrative responsibility for certain aspects of the ministry of the church, then there seems to be no good reason to prevent women from functioning as deacons. Regarding the question of women as deacons in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.8-13">1 Timothy 3:8&ndash;13</a>, it does not seem to the present author that this passage allows women to be deacons <span style="font-style:italic;">in the way deacons are understood in that situation</span> but there is a significant difference of viewpoint among evangelicals over the understanding of this passage, and it is much less clear to us exactly what deacons did at that time than it is clear what elders did.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With regard to other offices, such as treasurer, for example, or other staff positions such as youth minister or counseling director or children&rsquo;s minister, and so forth, the only question to be asked is whether these offices include the ruling <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 945  </span>and teaching functions reserved for elders in the New Testament. If not, then <span style="font-style:italic;">all of these offices would be open to women as well as to men</span> for we must be careful not to prohibit what the New Testament does not prohibit.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. No matter what kind of church government structure you currently find yourself in, are there ways in which you could be more encouraging and supportive to the current leaders in your church?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. If you are currently an officer in your church, or if you someday would like to be one, is your pattern of life such that you would like to see it imitated by others in the church? If you have had a part in the process of selecting church leaders, have you tended to emphasize the character traits and spiritual qualifications talked about in Scripture, or have you emphasized other qualifications that the world would look for in selecting its leaders?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Do you think that the current governing structure of your church works quite well? How could it be improved, without changing the basic philosophy of church government to which it is committed? Whether or not your church has officers who are called &ldquo;elders,&rdquo; who are the people who carry out the functions of elders in your church? Do you know if your own pastor would like to see some modifications in the government of your church, to enable him to carry out his task more effectively?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. Before reading this chapter, what was your view on the question of women serving as teaching pastors or elders in a church? How has this chapter changed your view, if at all? Why do you think people&rsquo;s emotions are often very strong concerning this issue? Can you explain how you personally feel (emotionally) about the teaching presented in this chapter? Does it seem right to you, or not?

		There are not many hymns&mdash;if any&mdash;written about church government! I have put here a hymn which thanks God for the blessings of being a member of God&rsquo;s people in general, and therefore a citizen of the heavenly Mount Zion, the heavenly city where God&rsquo;s people dwell. But in the hymn the author also uses Old Testament imagery from the journey of God&rsquo;s people through the wilderness (&ldquo;see the cloud and fire appear,&rdquo; v. 3), and the entire hymn can also be seen as one of thanks to God for the blessing of dwelling (spiritually) within the walls of the church today.

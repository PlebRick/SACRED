	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The term <span style="font-style:italic;">worship</span> is sometimes applied to all of a Christian&rsquo;s life, and it is rightly said that everything in our life should be an act of worship, and everything the church does should be considered worship, for everything we do should glorify God. However, in this chapter I am not using the word in that broad sense. Rather, I am using <span style="font-style:italic;">worship</span> in a more specific sense to refer to the music and words that Christians direct to God in praise, together with the heart attitudes that accompany that praise, especially when Christians assemble together. Since the chapters in this part of the book deal with the doctrine of the church, it is appropriate in this chapter to focus attention on the worship activities of the assembled church.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Definition and Purpose of Worship</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">Worship is the activity of glorifying God in his presence with our voices and hearts</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this definition we note that worship is an act of glorifying God. Yet all aspects of our lives are supposed to glorify God, so this definition specifies that worship is something we do especially when we come into God&rsquo;s presence, when we are conscious of adoration of him in our hearts, and when we praise him with our voices and speak about him so others may hear. Paul encourages the Christians in Colossae, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, <span style="font-style:italic;">teach and admonish one another</span> in all wisdom, and <span style="font-style:italic;">sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.16">Col. 3:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, the primary reason that God called us into the assembly of the church is that as a corporate assembly we might worship him. Edmund Clowney wisely says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God had demanded of Pharaoh, &ldquo;Let my people go, <span style="font-style:italic;">so that they may worship me</span> in the desert&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex7.16b">Ex. 7:16b</a>) … God brings them out that he might bring them in, into his assembly, to the great company of those who stand before his face … <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s assembly at Sinai is therefore the immediate goal of the exodus. God brings his people into his presence that they might hear his voice and worship him</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1004  </span>But Clowney explains that the worshiping assembly at Mount Sinai could not remain in session before God forever. Therefore God established other festivals in which the whole nation would assemble before him three times a year. He says that &ldquo;Israelites are a nation formed for worship, called to assemble in the courts of the Lord, and to praise together the name of the Most High.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet Clowney points out that, rather than worshiping God in a unified, holy assembly, the people turned aside to serving idols and, rather than assembling the people to worship before him, &ldquo;in judgment God scattered the people in exile.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But God promised that his purposes for his people would yet be fulfilled, that there would someday be a great assembly not just of Israel but of all nations before his throne (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is2.2-4">Isa. 2:2&ndash;4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is25.6-8">25:6&ndash;8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is49.22">49:22</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is66.18-21">66:18&ndash;21</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Je48.47">Jer. 48:47</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Je49.6">49:6</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Je48.39">39</a>). Clowney notes that the fulfillment of that promise began only when Jesus started to build his church:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Pentecost was the time of the firstfruits, the beginning of the great harvest of redemption. Peter preached the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel. The Spirit had been poured out, <span style="font-style:italic;">the worship of the new age had been ushered in. The church, the assembly for worship, was praising God.…</span> Now the ingathering had begun.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The gospel call is a call to worship, to turn from sin and call upon the name of the Lord.… The picture of the church as a worshiping assembly is nowhere more powerfully presented than by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.18-29">Heb. 12:18&ndash;29</a>).… In our worship in Christ&rsquo;s church we approach the throne of God the judge of all. <span style="font-style:italic;">We enter the festival assembly of the saints and the angels</span>. We gather in spirit with the spirits of just men made perfect. We enter the assembly of glory through Christ our mediator, and the blood of his atoning death …
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">Reverent corporate worship</span> then, is not optional for the church of God … Rather, it <span style="font-style:italic;">brings to expression the very being of the church</span>. It manifests on earth the reality of the heavenly assembly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Worship is therefore a <span style="font-style:italic;">direct</span> expression of our ultimate purpose for living, &ldquo;to glorify God and fully to enjoy him forever.&rdquo; God speaks of his &ldquo;sons&rdquo; and &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; as &ldquo;every one who is called by my name, whom I created <span style="font-style:italic;">for my glory</span> whom I formed and made&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.6-7">Isa. 43:6&ndash;7</a>). And Paul uses similar language when he says that &ldquo;we who first hoped in Christ have been destined and appointed <span style="font-style:italic;">to live for the praise of his glory</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.12">Eph. 1:12</a>). Scripture is clear here and in many other passages that God created us to glorify him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we reflect on the purpose of worship it also reminds us that <span style="font-style:italic;">God is worthy of worship and we are not</span>. Even the apostle John had to be told that he should not worship any creature, not even a powerful angel in heaven. When he &ldquo;fell down to worship&rdquo; at the feet of the angel who showed him marvelous visions in heaven, the angel said to him, &ldquo;You must not do that!… Worship God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.8-9">Rev. 22:8&ndash;9</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1005  </span>This is because God is jealous for his own honor and he rightly seeks his own honor. He says, &ldquo;I the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> your God am a jealous God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex20.5">Ex. 20:5</a>) and &ldquo;My glory I will not give to another&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is48.11">Isa. 48:11</a>). Something within us should tremble and rejoice at this fact. We should tremble with fear lest we rob God&rsquo;s glory from him. And we should rejoice that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">right</span> that God seek his own honor and be jealous for his own honor, for he, infinitely more than anything he has made, is <span style="font-style:italic;">worthy</span> of honor. The twenty-four elders in heaven feel this reverence and joy, for they fall down before God&rsquo;s throne and cast their crowns before him singing, &ldquo;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.11">Rev. 4:11</a>). When we feel the absolute <span style="font-style:italic;">rightness</span> of this deep within ourselves we then have the appropriate heart attitude for genuine worship.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because God is worthy of worship and seeks to be worshiped, everything in our worship services should be designed and carried out not to call attention to ourselves or bring glory to ourselves, but to call attention to God and to cause people to think about him. It would be appropriate for us frequently to re-evaluate the various elements in our Sunday services&mdash;the preaching, public prayer, leading of worship, special music, celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and even the announcements and the offering. Are they really bringing glory to God in the way they are done? Peter says that spiritual gifts are to be used in such a way that &ldquo;in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.11">1 Peter 4:11</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. The Results of Genuine Worship</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we worship God in the sense described above, truly giving him glory in our hearts and with our voices, several things happen as a result:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. We Delight in God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> God created us not only to glorify him but also to enjoy him and delight in his excellence. We probably experience delight in God more fully in worship than in any other activity in this life. David confesses that the &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; that he will seek for above all else is &ldquo;that I may dwell in the house of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, and to inquire in his temple&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps27.4">Ps. 27:4</a>). He also says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">In your presence there is fulness of joy</span> in your right hand are pleasures for evermore&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps16.11">Ps. 16:11</a>). Similarly, Asaph knows that God alone is the fulfillment of all his hopes and desires: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire besides you</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps73.25">Ps. 73:25</a>). And the sons of Korah say:

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The early church knew such joy in worship, for &ldquo;day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts, <span style="font-style:italic;">praising God</span> and having favor with all the people&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.46">Acts 2:46</a>). In fact, immediately after Jesus&rsquo; ascension into heaven, the disciples &ldquo;returned to Jerusalem with great joy, <span style="font-style:italic;">and were continually in the temple blessing God.</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.52-53">Luke 24:52&ndash;53</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Of course, such activity of continual praise cannot last forever in this age, for living in a fallen world requires that we give time to many other responsibilities as well. But extended praise does give us a foretaste of the atmosphere of heaven, where the four living creatures &ldquo;never cease to sing, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.8">Rev. 4:8</a>), and the other heavenly creatures and the redeemed who have died join in that heavenly worship and extol &ldquo;the Lamb who was slain&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re5.12">Rev. 5:12</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. God Delights in Us</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> What does God do when we worship him? The amazing truth of Scripture is that as the creation glorifies God, he also takes delight in it. When God first made the universe, he looked on all of it with delight, and saw that &ldquo;it was very good&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.31">Gen. 1:31</a>). God takes special delight in human beings whom he has created and redeemed. Isaiah reminded the people of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This truth should bring great encouragement to us, for as we love God and praise him we realize that we are bringing joy and delight to his heart. And the deepest joy of love is the joy of bringing delight to the heart of the one you love.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. We Draw Near to God: The Amazing Unseen Reality of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">New Covenant</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Worship</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In the old covenant believers could only draw near to God in a limited way through the temple ceremonies; indeed, most of the people of Israel could <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1007  </span>not enter into the temple itself, but had to remain in the courtyard. Even the priests could only go into the outer court of the temple, the &ldquo;Holy Place,&rdquo; when it was their appointed duty. But into the inner room of the temple, the &ldquo;Holy of Holies,&rdquo; no one could go except the high priest, and he only once a year (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.1-7">Heb. 9:1&ndash;7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now, under the new covenant, believers have the amazing privilege of being able to enter directly into the holy of holies in heaven when they worship. &ldquo;We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.19">Heb. 10:19</a> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">niv</span>). Since we have that confidence to enter into the very presence of God, the author of Hebrews encourages us, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Let us draw near</span> with a true heart in full assurance of faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.22">Heb. 10:22</a>). Worship in the New Testament church is not simply practice for some later heavenly experience of genuine worship, nor is it simply pretending, or going through some outward activities. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">genuine worship</span> in the presence of God himself, and when we worship we enter before his throne.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This reality is expressed more fully by the author of Hebrews in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12">12</a>, when he tells Christians that they have not come to a place like the earthly Mount Sinai where the people of Israel received the Ten Commandments from God, but they have come to something far better, the heavenly Jerusalem:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For <span style="font-style:italic;">you have not come</span> to what may be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers entreat that no further messages be spoken to them … <span style="font-style:italic;">But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God</span> the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to a judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.18-24">Heb. 12:18&ndash;24</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is the reality of new covenant worship: it actually <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> worship in the presence of God, though we do not now see him with our physical eyes, nor do we see the angels gathered around his throne or the spirits of believers who have gone before and are now worshiping in God&rsquo;s presence. But it is all there, and it is all real, more real and more permanent than the physical creation that we see around us, which will someday be destroyed in the final judgment. And if we believe Scripture to be true, then we must also believe it to be actually true that <span style="font-style:italic;">we ourselves</span> come to that place and join <span style="font-style:italic;">our</span> voices with those already worshiping in heaven whenever we come to God in worship. Our only appropriate response is this: &ldquo;Let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.28-29">Heb. 12:28&ndash;29</a>).

		Though this only speaks of one specific incident, it does not seem wrong to suppose that God will also make his presence known at other times among his people, whenever he is pleased with the praise they offer (even if he does not come in the form of a visible cloud). David says, &ldquo;Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22.3">Ps. 22:3</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. God Ministers to Us</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Although the primary purpose of worship is to glorify God, the Scriptures teach that in worship something also happens to us: we ourselves are built up or edified. To some extent this happens, of course, when we learn from the Bible teachings that are given or the words of encouragement that others speak to us&mdash;Paul says, &ldquo;Let all things be done for edification&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.26">1 Cor. 14:26</a>), and he says that we are to &ldquo;teach and admonish one another in all wisdom&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.16">Col. 3:16</a>), and to be &ldquo;addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.19">Eph. 5:19</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.24-25">Heb. 10:24&ndash;25</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But in addition to the edification that comes from growth in understanding the Bible and hearing words of encouragement from others, there is another kind of edification that occurs in worship: when we worship God he meets with us and directly ministers to us, strengthening our faith, intensifying our awareness of his presence, and granting refreshment to our spirits. Peter says that as Christians are continually coming to Christ (in worship and prayer and faith), they are then &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">being built up</span> as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.5">1 Peter 2:5</a> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">nasb</span>). When we come to worship we come into God&rsquo;s presence in a special way, and we may expect that he will meet us there and minister to us: as we &ldquo;draw near to the throne of grace&rdquo; we will &ldquo;receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.16">Heb. 4:16</a>). During genuine worship we will often experience an intensification of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, who is at work continually changing us into the likeness of Christ &ldquo;from one degree of glory to another&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co3.18">2 Cor. 3:18</a>).

The Lord&rsquo;s Enemies Flee</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When the people of Israel began to worship, God at times would fight for them against their enemies. For example, when the Moabites, Edomites, and Syrians came against Judah, King Jehoshaphat sent out the choir praising God in front of the army:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		He appointed those who were to sing to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> and praise him in holy array, as they went <span style="font-style:italic;">before the army</span> … And <span style="font-style:italic;">when they began to sing and praise</span> the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> set an ambush against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, when God&rsquo;s people offer him worship today, we may expect that the Lord will battle against demonic forces that oppose the gospel and cause them to flee.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">7. Unbelievers Know They Are in God&rsquo;s Presence</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Though Scripture does not emphasize evangelism as a primary purpose when the church meets for worship, Paul does tell the Corinthians to take thought for unbelievers and outsiders who come to their services, to be sure that the Christians speak in understandable ways (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.23">1 Cor. 14:23</a>). He also tells them that if the gift of prophecy is functioning properly, unbelievers will from time to time have the secrets of their heart disclosed, and they will fall on their face and &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">worship God and declare that God is really among you</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.25">1 Cor. 14:25</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.11">Acts 2:11</a>). But evangelism is not seen as a primary purpose when the church assembles for worship, and it would therefore not be right to have the only weekly gathering of believers designed primarily with an evangelistic purpose. Paul&rsquo;s concern is rather that visitors understand what is going on (and not think that Christians are &ldquo;mad,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.23">1 Cor. 14:23</a>), and that they recognize that &ldquo;God is really among you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.25">1 Cor. 14:25</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. The Eternal Value of Worship</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because worship glorifies God and fulfills the purpose for which God created us, it is an activity of eternal significance and great value. When Paul cautions the Ephesians not to waste their time but to use it well, he puts it in the context of living as those who are wise: &ldquo;Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, <span style="font-style:italic;">making the most of the time</span> because the days are evil&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.15-16">Eph. 5:15&ndash;16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul then explains what it is to be wise and to make the most of the time:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, <span style="font-style:italic;">singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart</span> always and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.17-20">Eph. 5:17&ndash;20</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore in the context of using time wisely and making the most of the time, Paul includes both singing of spiritual psalms to one another and singing to the Lord with our hearts.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This means that <span style="font-style:italic;">worship is doing the will of God!</span> Worship is the result of understanding &ldquo;what the will of the Lord is.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;making the most of the time.&rdquo; Moreover, because God is eternal and omniscient, the praise that we give him will <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1010  </span>never fade from his consciousness but will continue to bring delight to his heart for all eternity (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud25">Jude 25</a>: &ldquo;To the only God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now <span style="font-style:italic;">and for ever</span>&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that worship is an activity of great significance and eternal value is also evident in the fact that it is the primary activity carried on by those who are already in heaven (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.8-11">Rev. 4:8&ndash;11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re5.11-14">5:11&ndash;14</a>).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. How Can We Enter Into Genuine Worship?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Ultimately, worship is a spiritual activity and it must be empowered by the Holy Spirit working within us. This means that we must pray that the Holy Spirit will enable us to worship rightly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that genuine worship is to be carried on in the unseen, spiritual realm is evident in Jesus&rsquo; words:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father <span style="font-style:italic;">in spirit and truth</span> for such the Father seeks to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.23-24">John 4:23&ndash;24</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To worship &ldquo;in spirit and truth&rdquo; is best understood to mean not &ldquo;in the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">in the spiritual realm, in the realm of spiritual activity.</span>&rdquo; This means that true worship involves not only our physical bodies but also our spirits, the immaterial aspect of our existence that primarily acts in the unseen realm. Mary knew she was worshiping in that way, for she exclaimed, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">My soul</span> magnifies the Lord, and <span style="font-style:italic;">my spirit</span> rejoices in God my Savior&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.46-47">Luke 1:46&ndash;47</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should realize also that God continually &ldquo;seeks&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.23">John 4:23</a>) those who will worship him in the spiritual realm and therefore those whose spirit as well as body and mind is worshiping God. Such worship is not optional because those who worship God &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> worship in spirit and truth&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.24">24</a>). Unless our spirits are worshiping God we are not truly worshiping him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		An attitude of worship comes upon us when we begin to see God as he is and then respond to his presence. Even in heaven the seraphim who behold God&rsquo;s glory cry out, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is6.3">Isa. 6:3</a>). When the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water, and then saw the wind cease when he got into the boat, &ldquo;those in the boat <span style="font-style:italic;">worshiped him</span> saying, &ldquo;Truly you are the Son of God&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt14.33">Matt. 14:33</a>). The author of Hebrews knows that when we come into the presence of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.18-24">Heb. 12:18&ndash;24</a>), the proper response is to &ldquo;offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.28-29">Heb. 12:28&ndash;29</a>). Therefore genuine worship is not something that is self-generated or that can be worked up within ourselves. It <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1011  </span>must rather be the outpouring of our hearts <span style="font-style:italic;">in response</span> to a realization of who God is.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is appropriate to ask whether there is much genuine, deep, heartfelt worship in our churches. In many evangelical churches people do not truly worship God in their hearts until the last hymn, after the sermon has focused their attention on who God is so that they begin to rejoice in God with a heart full of praise. But then, just when heartfelt worship has begun, the service abruptly ends. It should be just beginning! If genuine worship is lacking in our churches, we should ask how we can bring ourselves to experience much more of the depth and richness of worship, which is the natural response of the believing heart to a clear awareness of God&rsquo;s presence and character.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Is there anything else we can do to make worship more effective? We must remember that worship is a spiritual matter (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.21-24">John 4:21&ndash;24</a>), and the primary solutions will therefore be spiritual ones. There will need to be much prayer in preparation for worship, especially on the part of those in leadership, asking that God will bless the worship times and make himself known to us. Also, congregations will need teaching about the spiritual nature of worship and the New Testament understanding of worship in God&rsquo;s presence (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.22-24">Heb. 12:22&ndash;24</a>). In addition, Christians need to be encouraged to make right any broken interpersonal relationships. Paul says that men are to lift holy hands &ldquo;without anger or quarreling&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.8">1 Tim. 2:8</a>), and Jesus reminds us that we are first to &ldquo;be reconciled&rdquo; to our brother, and then come before God&rsquo;s altar and offer a gift (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.24">Matt. 5:24</a>). In fact, John says that anyone who says, &ldquo;I love God&rdquo; but hates his brother &ldquo;is a liar&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.20">1 John 4:20</a>). Husbands particularly need to make sure they are living &ldquo;considerately&rdquo; with their wives, and honoring them, in order that their prayers &ldquo;may not be hindered&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.7">1 Peter 3:7</a>). And the entire church is responsible to watch &ldquo;that no &lsquo;root of bitterness&rsquo; spring up and cause trouble, and by it the many become defiled&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.15">Heb. 12:15</a>)&mdash;an indication that sin and broken relationships among a few can spread to many and result in the withholding of God&rsquo;s blessing from the whole congregation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, if we are truly to draw near to God in worship, there must be a striving for personal holiness of life. The author of Hebrews reminds believers to strive for &ldquo;the holiness without which no one will see the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.14">Heb. 12:14</a>), and Jesus says that it is the &ldquo;pure in heart&rdquo; who shall &ldquo;see God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.8">Matt. 5:8</a>)&mdash;a promise that is fulfilled partially in this life and completely in the age to come. Specifically in connection with prayer, John says, &ldquo;If our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.21">1 John 3:21</a>), but this principle certainly applies to worship as well, as we have boldness to come into God&rsquo;s presence to offer him praise. James indicates a similar concern when, immediately after saying, &ldquo;Draw near to God and he will draw near to you,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Cleanse</span> your hands, you sinners, and <span style="font-style:italic;">purify</span> your hearts, you men of double mind&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas4.8">James 4:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet the physical setting and the structure of worship services do matter, for <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1012  </span>there are indications that Jesus thought that the atmosphere of worship was very important. He &ldquo;entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.&rdquo; In explanation of this action, Jesus insisted that the temple was to be a house of prayer, for he said, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;My house shall be called a house of prayer&rsquo;; but you make it a den of robbers&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt21.12-13">Matt. 21:12&ndash;13</a>). He also told believers, &ldquo;When you pray, <span style="font-style:italic;">go into your room and shut the door</span> and pray to your Father who is in secret&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.6">Matt. 6:6</a>), not only because in our rooms we will not be seen by men, and will not pray so as to receive glory from men, but also because the knowledge that others are watching us in our prayers so easily distracts our attention, so that then we pray in part to be heard by others or at least so as not to offend them. This does not mean that corporate worship and prayer are forbidden (for both are very evident in both the Old Testament and New Testament), but it is to say that we should choose a <span style="font-style:italic;">setting</span> for prayer or for worship that avoids distractions as much as possible. This is consistent with the fact that worship is to be done in an orderly way, for &ldquo;God is not a God of confusion but of peace&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.33">1 Cor. 14:33</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.40">40</a>). The atmosphere and mood of worship are important, because we are to &ldquo;offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.28">Heb. 12:28</a>). This means that it is appropriate to come together as a church in a setting that is conducive to worship, one that is ordinarily private and free from distractions, giving opportunity to focus attention on the Lord.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Singing is especially important to worship in both Old and New Testaments. In our day there has been quite a change in both the standard English that is spoken by people and the musical forms that people are familiar with, and churches need to talk and plan openly and honestly in order to find a mix of songs that can be sung well by the whole congregation, and that people can genuinely identify with as a vehicle for expressing their praise to God. Songs that address God directly in the second person (that is, speaking to God as &ldquo;you&rdquo; rather than speaking about him as &ldquo;he&rdquo;) will often be especially effective as worship songs&mdash;though the Psalms show that both kinds of songs are pleasing to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition, it is important to allow enough time for the various aspects of corporate worship. Genuine prayer can certainly take time (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk6.12">Luke 6:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk22.39-46">22:39&ndash;46</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.12">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.2">13:2</a>). Solid Bible teaching can often take a long time as well (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt15.32">Matt. 15:32</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.7-11">Acts 20:7&ndash;11</a>). Moreover, genuine, heartfelt worship and praise will also take quite a bit of time if it is to be effective.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is true in part because different aspects of a worship service require <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1013  </span>different attitudes and states of mind. Listening to Bible teaching requires attentiveness to the text and the teacher. Praise requires joy and a focus on the Lord and his excellence. Prayers of petition require a focus on needs and a deep concern for others. Times when offerings are given require a focus on sacrificing ourselves to the Lord as well as giving to him from our means and trusting him to provide for our needs. The Lord&rsquo;s Supper requires a time of reflection, self-examination, and perhaps repentance, along with thanksgiving. But we cannot have all of these attitudes at once, for we are finite. Different attitudes of mind require time to attain and dwell in. For that reason it is impossible to fulfill all the tasks necessary for an assembled congregation simply in one hour on Sunday morning, and it is harmful even to try. Those who do try to do everything crowd too much into a brief time and fail to do anything well. If congregations are to fulfill the various purposes for which God wants them to assemble together, and especially to have extended times of reverent worship, they will probably need to find creative solutions that enable them to meet for longer periods of time, and omit or reschedule some activities that have become habitual or traditional on Sunday mornings but are really not necessary.

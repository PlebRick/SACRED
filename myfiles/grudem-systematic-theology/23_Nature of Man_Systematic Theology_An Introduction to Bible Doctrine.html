		How many parts are there to man? Everyone agrees that we have physical bodies. Most people (both Christians and non-Christians) sense that they also have an immaterial part&mdash;a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; that will live on after their bodies die.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But here the agreement ends. Some people believe that in addition to &ldquo;body&rdquo; and &ldquo;soul&rdquo; we have a third part, a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; that most directly relates to God. The view that man is made of three parts (<span style="font-style:italic;">body, soul, and spirit</span>) is called <span style="font-style:italic;">trichotomy</span>. Though this has been a common view in popular evangelical Bible teaching, there are few scholarly defenses of it today. According to many trichotomists, man&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> includes his intellect, his emotions, and his will. They maintain that all people have such a soul, and that the different elements of the soul can either serve God or be yielded to sin. They argue that man&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> is a higher faculty in man that comes alive when a person becomes a Christian (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.10">Rom. 8:10</a>: &ldquo;If Christ is in you, although your bodies are dead because of sin, <span style="font-style:italic;">your spirits are alive</span> because of righteousness&rdquo;). The spirit of a person then would be that part of him or her that most directly worships and prays to God (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.24">John 4:24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.3">Phil. 3:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Others have said that &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; is not a separate part of man, but simply another term for &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; and that both terms are used interchangeably in Scripture to talk about the immaterial part of man, the part that lives on after our bodies die. The view that man is made up of <span style="font-style:italic;">two parts</span> (body and soul/spirit) is called <span style="font-style:italic;">dichotomy</span>. Those who hold this view often agree that Scripture uses the word <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">רוּחַ</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK8120">H8120</a>, and Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">πνεῦμα</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4460">G4460</a>) more frequently when referring to our relationship to God, but such usage (they say) is not uniform, and the word <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> is also used in all the ways that <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> can be used.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Outside the realm of evangelical thought we find yet another view, the idea that man cannot exist at all apart from a physical body, and therefore there can be no separate existence for any &ldquo;soul&rdquo; after the body dies (although this view can allow for the resurrection of the whole person at some future time). The view that man <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 473  </span>is only one element, and that his body is the person, is called <span style="font-style:italic;">monism</span>. According to monism, the scriptural terms <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> are just other expressions for the &ldquo;person&rdquo; himself, or for the person&rsquo;s &ldquo;life.&rdquo; This view has not generally been adopted by evangelical theologians because so many scriptural texts seem clearly to affirm that our souls or spirits live on after our bodies die (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge35.18">Gen. 35:18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps31.5">Ps. 31:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.43">Luke 23:43</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.46">46</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.59">Acts 7:59</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.23-24">Phil. 1:23&ndash;24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.8">2 Cor. 5:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.23">Heb. 12:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.9">Rev. 6:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.4">20:4</a>; and chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.5.42.0.0.0.0.0">42</a>, on the intermediate state, below).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But the other two views continue to be held in the Christian world today. Although dichotomy has been held more commonly through the history of the church and is far more common among evangelical scholars today, trichotomy has also had many supporters.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This chapter will support the dichotomist view that man is two parts, body and soul (or spirit), but we shall also examine the arguments for trichotomy.

		Before asking whether Scripture views &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; as distinct parts of man, we must at the outset make it clear that the emphasis of Scripture is on the overall unity of man as created by God. When God made man he &ldquo;breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.7">Gen. 2:7</a>). Here Adam is a unified person with body and soul living and acting together. This original harmonious and unified state of man will occur again when Christ returns and we are fully redeemed in our bodies as well as our souls to live with him forever (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.51-54">1 Cor. 15:51&ndash;54</a>). Moreover, we are to grow in holiness and love for God in every aspect of our lives, in our bodies as well as in our spirits or souls (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.34">1 Cor. 7:34</a>). We are to &ldquo;cleanse ourselves from every defilement <span style="font-style:italic;">of body and spirit</span> and make holiness perfect in the fear of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co7.1">2 Cor. 7:1</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But once we have emphasized the fact that God created us to have a unity between body and soul, and that every action we take in this life is an act of our whole person, involving to some extent both body and soul, then we can go on to point out that Scripture quite clearly teaches that there is an immaterial part of man&rsquo;s nature. And we can investigate what that part is like.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Scripture Uses &ldquo;Soul&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; Interchangeably</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When we look at the usage of the biblical words translated &ldquo;soul&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">נֶפֶשׁ</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK5883">H5883</a>, and Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ψυχή</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK6034">G6034</a>) and &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">רוּחַ</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK8120">H8120</a>, and Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">πνεῦμα</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4460">G4460</a>), it appears that they are sometimes used interchangeably. For example, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn12.27">John 12:27</a>, Jesus says, &ldquo;Now is my <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 474  </span>troubled,&rdquo; whereas in a very similar context in the next chapter John says that Jesus was &ldquo;troubled in <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.21">John 13:21</a>). Similarly, we read Mary&rsquo;s words in <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.46-47">Luke 1:46&ndash;47</a>: &ldquo;My <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> magnifies the Lord, and my <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> rejoices in God my Savior.&rdquo; This seems to be quite an evident example of Hebrew parallelism, the poetic device in which the same idea is repeated using different but synonymous words. This interchangeability of terms also explains why people who have died and gone to heaven or hell can be called either &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.23">Heb. 12:23</a>, &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">spirits</span> of just men made perfect&rdquo;; also <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.19">1 Peter 3:19</a>, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">spirits</span> in prison&rdquo;) or &ldquo;souls&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.9">Rev. 6:9</a>, &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">souls</span> of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne&rdquo;; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.4">20:4</a>, &ldquo;the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. At Death, Scripture Says Either That the &ldquo;Soul&rdquo; Departs or the &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; Departs</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When Rachel died, Scripture says, &ldquo;Her <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> was departing (for she died)&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge35.18">Gen. 35:18</a>). Elijah prays that the dead child&rsquo;s &ldquo;soul&rdquo; would come into him again (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki17.21">1 Kings 17:21</a>), and Isaiah predicts that the Servant of the Lord would &ldquo;pour out his <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> [Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">נֶפֶשׁ</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK5883">H5883</a>] to death&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.12">Isa. 53:12</a>). In the New Testament God tells the rich fool, &ldquo;This night your soul [Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ψυχή</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK6034">G6034</a>] is required of you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk12.20">Luke 12:20</a>). On the other hand, sometimes death is viewed as the returning of the spirit to God. So David can pray, in words later quoted by Jesus on the cross, &ldquo;Into your hand I commit my <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps31.5">Ps. 31:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.46">Luke 23:46</a>). At death, &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> returns to God who gave it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ec12.7">Eccl. 12:7</a>). In the New Testament, when Jesus was dying, &ldquo;he bowed his head and gave up his spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn19.30">John 19:30</a>), and likewise Stephen before dying prayed, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.59">Acts 7:59</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In response to these passages, a trichotomist might argue that they are talking about different things, for when a person dies both his soul and his spirit do in fact go to heaven. But it should be noted that Scripture nowhere says that a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;soul and spirit&rdquo; departed or went to heaven or were yielded up to God. If soul and spirit were separate and distinct things, we would expect that such language would be affirmed somewhere, if only to assure the reader that no essential part of the person is left behind. Yet we find no such language: the biblical authors do not seem to care whether they say that the soul departs or the spirit departs at death, for both seem to mean the same thing.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should also note that these Old Testament verses quoted above indicate that it is not correct, as some have claimed, to say that the Old Testament so emphasizes the unity of man that it has no conception of the existence of the soul apart from the body. Certainly several of these Old Testament passages imply that the authors recognize that a person continues to exist after his or her body dies.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 475  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Man Is Said to Be Either &ldquo;Body and Soul&rdquo; or &ldquo;Body and Spirit&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Jesus tells us not to fear those who &ldquo;kill the body but cannot kill the soul,&rdquo; but that we should rather &ldquo;fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.28">Matt. 10:28</a>). Here the word &ldquo;soul&rdquo; clearly must refer to the part of a person that exists after death. It cannot mean &ldquo;person&rdquo; or &ldquo;life,&rdquo; for it would not make sense to speak of those who &ldquo;kill the body but cannot kill the person,&rdquo; or who &ldquo;kill the body but cannot kill the life,&rdquo; unless there is some aspect of the person that lives on after the body is dead. Moreover, when Jesus talks about &ldquo;soul and body&rdquo; he seems quite clearly to be talking about the entire person even though he does not mention &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; as a separate component. The word &ldquo;soul&rdquo; seems to stand for the entire nonphysical part of man.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, man is sometimes said to be &ldquo;body and spirit.&rdquo; Paul wants the Corinthian church to deliver an erring brother to Satan &ldquo;for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.5">1 Cor. 5:5</a>). It is not that Paul has forgotten the salvation of the man&rsquo;s soul as well; he simply uses the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; to refer to the whole of the person&rsquo;s immaterial existence. Similarly, James says that &ldquo;the body apart from the spirit is dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.26">James 2:26</a>), but mentions nothing about a separate soul. Moreover, when Paul speaks of growth in personal holiness, he approves the woman who is concerned with &ldquo;how to be holy in body and spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.34">1 Cor. 7:34</a>), and he suggests that this covers the whole of the person&rsquo;s life. Even more explicit is <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co7.1">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>, where he says, &ldquo;let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God.&rdquo; Cleansing ourselves from defilement of the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; or of the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; covers the whole immaterial side of our existence (see also <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.10">Rom. 8:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.3">1 Cor. 5:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.5">Col. 2:5</a>).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. The &ldquo;Soul&rdquo; Can Sin or the &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; Can Sin</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Those who hold to trichotomy will usually agree that the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; can sin since they think that the soul includes the intellect, the emotions, and the will. (We see the fact that our souls can sin implied in verses such as <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.22">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re18.14">Rev. 18:14</a>.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The trichotomist, however, generally thinks of the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; as purer than the soul, and, when renewed, as free from sin and responsive to the prompting of the Holy Spirit. This understanding (which sometimes finds its way into popular Christian preaching and writing) is not really supported by the biblical text. When Paul encourages the Corinthians to cleanse themselves &ldquo;from every defilement of body and <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co7.1">2 Cor. 7:1</a>), he clearly implies that there can be defilement (or sin) in our spirits. Similarly, he speaks of the unmarried woman who is concerned with how to be holy &ldquo;in body and <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.34">1 Cor. 7:34</a>). Other verses speak in similar ways. For example, the Lord hardened the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of Sihon the king of Heshbon (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt2.30">Deut. 2:30</a>). <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps78">Psalm 78</a> speaks of the rebellious people of Israel &ldquo;whose <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> was not faithful to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps78.8">Ps. 78:8</a>). A &ldquo;haughty <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span>&rdquo; goes before a fall (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr16.18">Prov. 16:18</a>), and it is possible for sinful people to be &ldquo;proud in spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ec7.8">Eccl. 7:8</a>). Isaiah speaks of those &ldquo;who err in spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is29.24">Isa. 29:24</a>). Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 476  </span>&ldquo;spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da5.20">Dan. 5:20</a>). The fact that &ldquo;All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> weighs the spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr16.2">Prov. 16:2</a>) implies that it is possible for our spirits to be wrong in God&rsquo;s sight. Other verses imply a possibility of sin in our spirits (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps32.2">Ps. 32:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps51.10">51:10</a>). Finally, the fact that Scripture approves of one &ldquo;who <span style="font-style:italic;">rules his spirit</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr16.32">Prov. 16:32</a>) implies that our spirits are not simply the spiritually pure parts of our lives that are to be followed in all cases, but that they can have sinful desires or directions as well.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Everything That the Soul Is Said to Do, the Spirit Is Also Said to Do, and Everything That the Spirit Is Said to Do the Soul Is Also Said to Do</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Those who advocate trichotomy face a difficult problem defining clearly just what the difference is between the soul and the spirit (from their perspective). If Scripture gave clear support to the idea that our spirit is the part of us that directly relates to God in worship and prayer, while our soul includes our intellect (thinking), our emotions (feeling), and our will (deciding), then trichotomists would have a strong case. However, Scripture appears not to allow such a distinction to be made.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the one hand, the activities of thinking, feeling, and deciding things are not said to be done by our souls only. Our spirits can also experience emotions, for example, as when Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;spirit was provoked within him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.16">Acts 17:16</a>), or when Jesus was &ldquo;troubled in spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.21">John 13:21</a>). It is also possible to have a &ldquo;downcast spirit,&rdquo; which is the opposite of a &ldquo;cheerful heart&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr17.22">Prov. 17:22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, the functions of knowing, perceiving, and thinking are also said to be done by our spirits. For instance, Mark speaks of Jesus &ldquo;perceiving [Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐπιγινώσκω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2105">G2105</a>, &ldquo;knowing&rsquo;] in his spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk2.8">Mark 2:8</a>). When the Holy Spirit &ldquo;bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.16">Rom. 8:16</a>), our spirits receive and understand that witness, which is certainly a function of knowing something. In fact, our spirits seem to know our thoughts quite deeply, for Paul asks, &ldquo;What person knows a man&rsquo;s thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co2.11">1 Cor. 2:11</a>). (Cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Is29.24">Isa. 29:24</a>, speaking of those who now &ldquo;err in spirit&rdquo; but &ldquo;will come to understanding.&rdquo;)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The point of these verses is not to say that it is the spirit rather than the soul that feels and thinks things, but rather that &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; are both terms used of the immaterial side of people generally, and it is difficult to see any real distinction between the use of the terms.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, we should not slip into the mistake of thinking that certain activities (such as thinking, feeling, or deciding things) are done by only one part of us. Rather, these activities are done by the whole person. When we think or feel things, certainly our physical bodies are involved at every point as well. Whenever we think we use the physical brain God has given us. Similarly, our brain and our entire nervous system are involved when we feel emotion, and sometimes those emotions are involved in physical sensations in other parts of our bodies. This is just to reemphasize what was said at the beginning of our discussion, that the overall focus of Scripture is primarily on man as a unity, with our physical bodies and the nonphysical part of our persons functioning together as a unity.
	</p>

		On the other hand, the trichotomist claim that our spirit is that element of us that relates most directly to God in worship and in prayer does not seem to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 477  </span>borne out by Scripture. We often read about our <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> worshiping God and relating to him in other kinds of spiritual activity. &ldquo;To you, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, I lift up my <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps25.1">Ps. 25:1</a>). &ldquo;For God alone my soul waits in silence&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps62.1">Ps. 62:1</a>). &ldquo;Bless the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, O my <span style="font-style:italic;">soul;</span> and all that is within me, bless his holy name!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.1">Ps. 103:1</a>). &ldquo;Praise the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, O my soul!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps146.1">Ps. 146:1</a>). &ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.46">Luke 1:46</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These passages indicate that our souls can worship God, praise him, and give thanks to him. Our souls can pray to God, as Hannah implies when she says, &ldquo;I have been pouring out my soul before the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa1.15">1 Sam. 1:15</a>). In fact, the great commandment is to &ldquo;love the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt6.5">Deut. 6:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk12.30">Mark 12:30</a>). Our souls can long for God and thirst for him (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps42.1">Ps. 42:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps42.2">2</a>), and can &ldquo;hope in God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps42.5">Ps. 42:5</a>). Our souls can rejoice and delight in God, for David says, &ldquo;My soul shall rejoice in the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, exulting in his deliverance&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps35.9">Ps. 35:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Is61.10">Isa. 61:10</a>). The psalmist says, &ldquo;My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps119.20">Ps. 119:20</a>), and, &ldquo;My soul keeps your testimonies; I love them exceedingly&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps119.167">Ps. 119:167</a>). There seems to be no area of life or relationship to God in which Scripture says our spirits are active rather than our souls. Both terms are used to speak of all of the aspects of our relationship to God.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, it would be wrong, in the light of these passages, to suggest that only our souls (or spirits) worship God, for our bodies are involved in worship as well. We are a unity of body and soul/spirit. Our physical brains think about God when we worship and when we love him with all of our &ldquo;minds&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk12.30">Mark 12:30</a>). David, longing to be in God&rsquo;s presence, can say, &ldquo;My flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where no water is&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps63.1">Ps. 63:1</a>). Again, we read, &ldquo;My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps84.2">Ps. 84:2</a>). It is obvious that when we pray aloud or sing praise to God, our lips and our vocal cords are involved, and sometimes worship and prayer in Scripture involves clapping of hands (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps47.1">Ps. 47:1</a>) or lifting of hands to God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps28.2">Pss. 28:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps63.4">63:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps134.2">134:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps143.6">143:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.8">1 Tim. 2:8</a>). Moreover, the playing of musical instruments in praise to God is an act that involves our physical bodies as well as the physical materials of which the musical instruments are made (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps150.3-5">Ps. 150:3&ndash;5</a>). We worship him as whole persons.

		In conclusion, Scripture does not seem to support any distinction between soul and spirit. There does not seem to be a satisfactory answer to the questions that we may address to a trichotomist, &ldquo;What can the spirit do that the soul cannot do? What can the soul do that the spirit cannot do?&rdquo;

Paul could be simply piling up synonyms for emphasis, as is sometimes done elsewhere in Scripture. For example, Jesus says, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your <span style="font-style:italic;">heart</span> and with all your <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> and with all your <span style="font-style:italic;">mind</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt22.37">Matt. 22:37</a>).

The problem is even greater in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk12.30">Mark 12:30</a>: &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your <span style="font-style:italic;">heart</span> and with all your <span style="font-style:italic;">soul</span> and with all your <span style="font-style:italic;">mind</span> and with all your <span style="font-style:italic;">strength.</span>&rdquo; If we go on the principle that such lists of terms tell us about more parts to man, then if we also add spirit to this list (and perhaps body as well), we would have five or six parts to man! But that is certainly a false conclusion. It is far better to understand Jesus as simply piling up roughly synonymous terms for emphasis to demonstrate that we must love God with all of our being.

		Likewise, in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th5.23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a> Paul is not saying that soul and spirit are distinct entities, but simply that, whatever our immaterial part is called, he wants God to continue to sanctify us wholly to the day of Christ.

The author is not saying that the Word of God can divide &ldquo;soul <span style="font-style:italic;">from</span> spirit,&rdquo; but he is using a number of terms (soul, spirit, joints, marrow, thoughts and intentions of the heart) that speak of the deep inward parts of our being that are not hidden from the penetrating power of the Word of God. If we wish to call these our &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; then Scripture pierces into the midst of it and divides it and discovers its inmost intentions. If we wish to call this inmost nonphysical side of our being our &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; then Scripture penetrates into the midst of it and divides it and knows its deepest intentions and thoughts. Or if we wish to think metaphorically of our inmost being as hidden in our joints and in the marrow, then we can think of Scripture being like a sword that divides our joints or that pierces deeply into our bones and even divides the marrow in the midst of the bones. In all of these cases the Word of God is so powerful that it will search out and expose all disobedience and lack of submission to God. In any case, soul and spirit are not thought of as separate parts; they are simply additional terms for our inmost being.

In this context, &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; might almost be translated &ldquo;Spiritual.&rdquo; But the passage does not imply that Christians have a spirit whereas non-Christians do not, or that the spirit of a Christian is alive while the spirit of a non-Christian is not. Paul is not talking about different parts of man at all, but about coming under the influence of the Holy Spirit.

But nothing in this verse suggests that he regards his spirit as different from his soul. Such a misunderstanding results only if it is assumed that &ldquo;mind&rdquo; is part of the soul&mdash;a trichotomist claim that, as we noted above, is very difficult to substantiate from Scripture. Paul probably could equally have said, &ldquo;My soul prays but my mind is unfruitful.&rdquo; The point is simply that there is a nonphysical element to our existence that can at times function apart from our conscious awareness of how it is functioning.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5.</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> The Argument From Personal Experience.</span> Christians have a &ldquo;spiritual perception,&rdquo; an inner awareness of the presence of God experienced in worship and in prayer. At this deep inward level we can also at times feel spiritually troubled, or depressed, or perhaps have a sense of the presence of hostile demonic forces. Often this perception is distinct from our conscious, rational thought processes. Paul realizes that at times his spirit prays but his mind does not understand (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.14">1 Cor. 14:14</a>). But does inward spiritual perception occur in something other than what the Bible calls our &ldquo;soul&rdquo;? If we were using the vocabulary of Mary, we would be happy to say, &ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.46">Luke 1:46</a>). David would say, &ldquo;Bless the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, O my soul&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.1">Ps. 103:1</a>). Jesus would tell us to love God with all our soul (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk12.30">Mark 12:30</a>). The apostle Paul uses the word <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span> but it is simply a difference in terminology and does not point to a different part of man. There is a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; within us that can perceive things in the spiritual realm (note <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.16">Rom. 8:16</a>; also <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.16">Acts 17:16</a>), but we could just as well speak of it as our &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and mean the same thing, for Scripture uses both terms.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">What Makes Us Different From Animals?</span> It is true that we have spiritual abilities that make us different from animals: we are able to relate to God in worship and prayer, and we enjoy spiritual life in fellowship with God who is spirit. But we should not assume that we have a distinct element called &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; that allows us to do this, for with our minds we can love God, read and understand his words, and believe his Word to be true. Our souls can worship God and rejoice in him (see above). Our bodies will also be resurrected and live with God forever. Therefore we do not have to say that we have a part distinct from our souls and bodies that makes us different from animals, for our souls and bodies (including our minds) relate to God in ways animals never can. Rather, what makes us different from animals is the spiritual abilities that God has given to both our bodies and souls (or spirits).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The question of whether an animal has a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; simply depends on how we define soul. If we define &ldquo;soul&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;the intellect, emotions, and will,&rdquo; then <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 481  </span>we will have to conclude that at least the higher animals have a soul. But if we define our &ldquo;soul&rdquo; as we have in this chapter, to mean the immaterial element of our nature that relates to God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.1">Ps. 103:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.46">Luke 1:46</a>; et al.) and lives forever (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.9">Rev. 6:9</a>), then animals do not have a soul. The fact that the Hebrew word <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">נֶפֶשׁ</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK5883">H5883</a>, &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; is sometimes used of animals (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.21">Gen. 1:21</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge9.4">9:4</a>) shows that the word can sometimes simply mean &ldquo;life&rdquo;; it does not mean that animals have the same kind of soul as man.

When Paul says, &ldquo;Your spirits are alive because of righteousness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.10">Rom. 8:10</a>), he apparently means &ldquo;alive to God,&rdquo; but he does not imply that our spirits were completely &ldquo;dead&rdquo; before, only that they were living out of fellowship with God and were dead in that sense. In the same way, we as whole persons were &ldquo;dead&rdquo; in &ldquo;trespasses and sins&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.1">Eph. 2:1</a>), but we were made alive to God, and we now must consider ourselves &ldquo;dead to sin and alive to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.11">Rom. 6:11</a>). It is not just that one part of us (called the spirit) has been made alive; we as whole persons are a &ldquo;new creation&rdquo; in Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.17">2 Cor. 5:17</a>).

		The tripartite conception of man originated in Greek philosophy, which conceived of the relation of the body and the spirit of man to each other after the analogy of the mutual relation between the material universe and God. It was thought that, just as the latter could enter into communion with each other only by means of a third substance or an intermediate being, so the former could enter into mutual vital relationships only by means of a third or intermediate element, namely, the soul.

		Trichotomy can also have an anti-intellectual tendency. If we think of the spirit as that element of us that relates most directly to God, and if we think that the spirit is something distinct from our intellect, emotions, and will, we can easily fall into an anti-intellectual kind of Christianity that thinks that vigorous academic work is somehow &ldquo;unspiritual&rdquo;&mdash;a view that contradicts Jesus&rsquo; command to love God with all our &ldquo;mind&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk12.30">Mark 12:30</a>) and Paul&rsquo;s desire to &ldquo;take every thought captive to obey Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co10.5">2 Cor. 10:5</a>). Such a separation of the realm of the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; from the realm of the intellect can too easily lead to a neglect of sound doctrine or of the need for extensive teaching and knowledge of the Word of God&mdash;in contradiction to Paul&rsquo;s goal that he would work among God&rsquo;s people to further both their &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and their &ldquo;knowledge of the truth which accords with godliness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.1">Titus 1:1</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.9">9</a>). Similarly, if we think of our spirits as a distinct part of us that relates most directly to God, we can easily begin to neglect the role of Bible study and mature wisdom in making decisions, and place too much reliance on &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; discernment in the realm of guidance, an emphasis that has, through the history of the church, led many zealous Christians astray into false teaching and unwise practices. Finally, trichotomy can subtlely influence us to think that our emotions are not important or not really spiritual, since they are thought to be part of our soul, not part of our spirit.

		By contrast, if we hold to a view of dichotomy that upholds the overall unity of man, it will be much easier to avoid the error of depreciating the value of our intellects, emotions, or physical bodies. We will not think of our bodies as inherently evil or unimportant. Such a view of dichotomy within unity will also help us to remember that, in this life, there is a continual interaction between our body and our spirit, and that they affect each other: &ldquo;A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a downcast spirit dries up the bones&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr17.22">Prov. 17:22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, a healthy emphasis on dichotomy within an overall unity reminds us that Christian growth must include all aspects of our lives. We are continually to &ldquo;cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co7.1">2 Cor. 7:1</a>). We are to be &ldquo;increasing in the knowledge of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.10">Col. 1:10</a>), and our emotions and desires are to conform increasingly to the &ldquo;desires of the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.17">Gal. 5:17</a>), including an increase in godly emotions such as peace, joy, love, and so forth (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.22">Gal. 5:22</a>).

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A number of non-Christian philosophers have vigorously challenged the idea that man has any immaterial part at all such as a soul or spirit. Perhaps partially in response to such criticism, some evangelical theologians have seemed hesitant to affirm dichotomy in human existence. They have instead affirmed repeatedly that the Bible views man as a unity&mdash;a fact which is true but should not be used to deny that Scripture also views man&rsquo;s unified nature as made up of two distinct elements. Of course, philosophers who assume that there is no spiritual realm beyond the reach of our sense perception, and who then go from that assumption to argue on the basis of our sense perception that there is no God, or heaven, or angels, or demons, will use similar arguments to deny the existence of a distinct soul within human beings. The perception that we have a spirit or soul belongs to the invisible, spiritual realm, and is, even in Christians, generally only a faint, subjective perception. Therefore, our knowledge of the existence of the human soul must be primarily based on Scripture, in which God clearly testifies to the existence of this immaterial aspect of our beings. The fact that this truth about our existence cannot be clearly known apart from the testimony of Scripture should not cause us to shrink from affirming it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture is very clear that we do have a soul that is distinct from our physical bodies, which not only can function somewhat independently of our ordinary thought processes (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.14">1 Cor. 14:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.16">Rom. 8:16</a>), but also, when we die, is able to go on consciously acting and relating to God apart from our physical bodies. Jesus told the dying thief, &ldquo;Today you will be with me in Paradise&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.43">Luke 23:43</a>), even though, for both of them, their physical bodies were soon to die. When Stephen was dying, he knew he would immediately pass into the presence of the Lord, for he prayed, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.59">Acts 7:59</a>). Paul does not fear death, for he says, &ldquo;My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.23">Phil. 1:23</a>). He contrasts that with remaining in this life, which he calls &ldquo;to remain in the flesh&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.24">Phil. 1:24</a>). In fact, he says, &ldquo;We would rather be <span style="font-style:italic;">away from the body</span> and at home with the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.8">2 Cor. 5:8</a>), indicating a confidence that if he were to die physically his spirit would go into the Lord&rsquo;s presence and there enjoy fellowship with the Lord at once. The book of Revelation reminds us that &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">souls</span> of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.9">Rev. 6:9</a>) are in heaven and are able to cry out to God to bring justice on the earth (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.10">Rev. 6:10</a>; cf. also <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.4">20:4</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore, although we must agree that, in this life, Scripture views us as a unity in which body and spirit act together as one person, nonetheless, there will be a time between our death and the day Christ returns when our spirits will temporarily exist apart from our physical bodies.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 484  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">F. Where Do Our Souls Come From?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What is the origin of our individual souls? Two views have been common in the history of the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">Creationism</span> is the view that God creates a new soul for each person and sends it to that person&rsquo;s body sometime between conception and birth. <span style="font-style:italic;">Traducianism</span> on the other hand, holds that the soul as well as the body of a child are inherited from the baby&rsquo;s mother and father at the time of conception. Both views have had numerous defenders in the history of the church, with creationism eventually becoming the prevailing view in the Roman Catholic Church. Luther was in favor of traducianism, while Calvin favored creationism. On the other hand, there are some later Calvinist theologians such as Jonathan Edwards and A.H. Strong who favored traducianism (as do most Lutherans today). Creationism has had many modern evangelical advocates as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There is one other popular view called <span style="font-style:italic;">pre-existentianism</span> namely, that the souls of people exist in heaven long before their bodies are conceived in the wombs of their mothers, and that God then brings the soul to earth to be joined with the baby&rsquo;s body as he or she grows in the womb. But this view is not held by either Roman Catholic or Protestant theologians and is dangerously akin to ideas of reincarnation found in Eastern religions. Moreover, there is no support for this view in Scripture. Before we were conceived in the wombs of our mothers, we simply did not exist. We were not. Of course, God looked forward into the future and knew that we would exist, but that is far removed from saying that we actually did exist at some previous time. Such an idea would tend to make us view this present life as transitional or unimportant and make us think of life in the body as less desirable and the bearing and raising of children as less important.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In favor of traducianism it may be argued that God created man in his own image (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.27">Gen. 1:27</a>), and this includes a likeness to God in the amazing ability to &ldquo;create&rdquo; other human beings like ourselves. Therefore, just as the rest of the animal and plant world bears descendants &ldquo;according to their kinds&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.24">Gen. 1:24</a>), so Adam and Eve also were able to bear children who were like themselves, with a spiritual nature as well as a physical body. This would imply that the spirits or souls of Adam and Eve&rsquo;s children were derived from Adam and Eve themselves. Moreover, Scripture sometimes can speak of descendants being somehow present in the body of someone in the previous generation, as when the author of Hebrews says that when Melchizedek met Abraham, &ldquo;Levi … was still in the loins of his ancestor&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb7.10">Heb. 7:10</a>). Finally, traducianism could explain how the sins of the parents can be passed on to the children without making God directly responsible for the creation of a soul that is sinful or has a disposition that would tend toward sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, the biblical arguments in favor of creationism seem to speak more directly to the issue and give quite strong support for this view. First, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps127">Psalm 127</a> says that &ldquo;sons are a heritage from the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, the fruit of the womb a reward&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps127.3">Ps. 127:3</a>). This indicates that not only the soul, but also the entire person of the child, including his or her body, is a gift from God. From this standpoint, it seems strange to think of the mother and father as being responsible by themselves for <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 485  </span>any aspect of the child&rsquo;s existence. Was it not the Lord who, David says, &ldquo;knit me together in my mother&rsquo;s womb&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps139.13">Ps. 139:13</a>)? Isaiah says that God gives breath to the people on the earth and &ldquo;spirit to those who walk in it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is42.5">Isa. 42:5</a>). Zechariah talks of God as the one &ldquo;who forms the spirit of man within him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Zec12.1">Zech. 12:1</a> NIV). The author of Hebrews speaks of God as &ldquo;the Father of spirits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.9">Heb. 12:9</a>). It is hard to escape the conclusion from these passages that God is the one who creates our spirits or souls.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet we must be cautious in drawing conclusions from this data. Our discussion of the doctrine of God&rsquo;s providence in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.16.0.0.0.0.0">16</a> demonstrated that God usually acts through secondary causes. God often brings about the results he seeks through the actions of human beings. Certainly this is so in the conception and bearing of children. Even if we say that God does create individual souls for human beings before they are born, and that he is the one who allows children to be conceived and born, we must also recognize that apart from the physical union of man and woman in the conception of a child, no children are born! So we must not make the mistake of saying that the father and mother have no role in the creation of the child. Even if we say that God is the &ldquo;Father of spirits&rdquo; and the Creator of every human soul, just as he is the Maker and Creator of each of us, we must still also affirm that God carries out this creative activity through the amazing process of human procreation. Whether God involves the human mother and father to some degree in the process of the creation of a soul as well as of a physical body, is impossible for us to say. It is something that occurs in the invisible realm of the spirit, which we do not have information about except from Scripture. And on this point Scripture simply does not give us enough information to decide.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, the arguments listed above in favor of traducianism must be said not to be very compelling ones. The fact that Adam and Eve bear children in their own image (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.3">Gen. 5:3</a>) could suggest that children somehow inherit a soul from their parents, but it might also indicate that God gives an individually created soul to the child and that that soul is consistent with the hereditary traits and personality characteristics that God allowed the child to have through its descent from its parents. The idea that Levi was still in the body of Abraham (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb7.10">Heb. 7:10</a>) is best understood in a representative, or figurative, sense, not in a literal sense. Moreover, it is not simply Levi&rsquo;s soul that is talked about in any case, but Levi himself, as a whole person, including body and soul&mdash;yet Levi&rsquo;s body was certainly not physically present in any meaningful sense in Abraham&rsquo;s body, for there was no distinct combination of genes at that time that could be said to be Levi and no one else. Finally, since God brings about events in the physical world that are consistent with the voluntary activities of human beings, there does not seem to be any real theological difficulty in saying that God gives each child a human soul that has tendencies to sin that are similar to the tendencies found in the parents. In fact, we read in the Ten Commandments of God &ldquo;visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate [him]&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex20.5">Ex. 20:5</a>), and, quite apart from the question of the human soul, we know from human experience that children do in fact tend to <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 486  </span>imitate both the good and bad traits in their parents&rsquo; lives, not only as a result of imitation but also because of hereditary disposition. For God to give each child a human soul that accords with the imitation of parents that we see in the lives of children would simply be an indication that God, in creating a human soul, acts consistently with the way he acts in relation to the human race in other matters as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In conclusion, it seems hard to avoid the testimony of Scripture to the effect that God actively creates each human soul, just as he is active in all the events of his creation. But the degree to which he allows the use of intermediate or secondary causes (that is, inheritance from parents) is simply not explained for us in Scripture. Therefore, it does not seem profitable for us to spend any more time speculating on this question.

		 1. In your own Christian experience, are you aware that you are more than just a physical body, that you have a nonphysical part that might be called a soul or spirit?

Is it enough to be aware of what you are saying without really meaning it? If you really mean the words with your whole being, then what aspects of your person would be involved in genuine prayer and worship? Do you think you tend to neglect one or another aspect at times?

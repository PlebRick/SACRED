		<span style="font-weight:bold;">EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the previous chapters we talked about the gospel call (in which God calls us to trust in Christ for salvation), regeneration (in which God imparts new spiritual life to us), and conversion (in which we respond to the gospel call in repentance for sin and faith in Christ for salvation). But <span style="font-style:italic;">what about the guilt of our sin?</span> The gospel call invited us to trust in Christ for forgiveness of sins. Regeneration made it possible for us to respond to that invitation. In conversion we did respond, trusting in Christ for forgiveness of sins. Now the next step in the process of applying redemption to us is that God must respond to our faith and do what he promised, that is, actually declare our sins to be forgiven. This must be a <span style="font-style:italic;">legal declaration</span> concerning our relationship to God&rsquo;s laws, stating that we are completely forgiven and no longer liable to punishment.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A right understanding of justification is absolutely crucial to the whole Christian faith. Once Martin Luther realized the truth of justification by faith alone, he became a Christian and overflowed with the new-found joy of the gospel. The primary issue in the Protestant Reformation was a dispute with the Roman Catholic Church over justification. If we are to safeguard the truth of the gospel for future generations, we must understand the truth of justification. Even today, a true view of justification is the dividing line between the biblical gospel of salvation by faith alone and all false gospels of salvation based on good works.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Paul gives an overview of the process by which God applies salvation to us, he mentions justification explicitly: &ldquo;Those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also <span style="font-style:italic;">justified;</span> and those whom he justified he also glorified&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.30">Rom. 8:30</a>). As we explained in a previous chapter, the word <span style="font-style:italic;">called</span> here refers to the effective calling of the gospel, which includes regeneration and brings forth the response of repentance and faith (or conversion) on our part. After effective calling and the response that it initiates on our part, the next step in the application of redemption is &ldquo;justification.&rdquo; Here Paul mentions that this is something that God himself does: &ldquo;Those whom he called <span style="font-style:italic;">he also justified.</span>&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, Paul quite clearly teaches that this justification comes <span style="font-style:italic;">after</span> our faith and <span style="font-style:italic;">as God&rsquo;s response to</span> our faith. He says that God &ldquo;justifies him who <span style="font-style:italic;">has faith</span> in Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.26">Rom. 3:26</a>), and that &ldquo;a man is justified <span style="font-style:italic;">by faith</span> apart from works of law&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.28">Rom. 3:28</a>). He says, &ldquo;Since we are justified <span style="font-style:italic;">by faith</span> we have peace with God <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 723  </span>through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.1">Rom. 5:1</a>). Moreover, &ldquo;a man is not justified by works of the law but <span style="font-style:italic;">through faith</span> in Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.16">Gal. 2:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Just what is justification? We may define it as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">Justification is an instantaneous legal act of God in which he (1) thinks of our sins as forgiven and Christ&rsquo;s righteousness as belonging to us, and (2) declares us to be righteous in his sight</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In explaining the elements of this definition, we will look first at the second half of it, the aspect of justification in which God &ldquo;declares us to be righteous in his sight.&rdquo; The reason for treating these items in reverse order is that the emphasis of the New Testament in the use of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">justification</span> and related terms is on the second half of the definition, the legal declaration by God. But there are also passages that show that this declaration is based on the fact that God first thinks of righteousness as belonging to us. So both aspects must be treated, even though the New Testament terms for justification focus on the legal declaration by God.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Justification Includes a Legal Declaration By God</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The use of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">justify</span> in the Bible indicates that justification is a legal declaration by God. The verb <span style="font-style:italic;">justify</span> in the New Testament (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">δικαιόω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1467">G1467</a>) has a range of meanings, but a very common sense is &ldquo;to declare righteous.&rdquo; For example, we read, &ldquo;When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors <span style="font-style:italic;">justified</span> God, having been baptized with the baptism of John&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk7.29">Luke 7:29</a>). Of course the people and the tax collectors did not <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> God to be righteous&mdash;that would be impossible for anyone to do. Rather they <span style="font-style:italic;">declared</span> God to be righteous. This is also the sense of the term in passages where the New Testament talks about us being declared righteous by God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.20">Rom. 3:20</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.26">26</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.28">28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.30">8:30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro10.4">10:4</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro10.10">10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.16">Gal. 2:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.24">3:24</a>). This sense is particularly evident, for example, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.5">Romans 4:5</a>: &ldquo;And to one who does not work but trusts him who <span style="font-style:italic;">justifies the ungodly</span> his faith is reckoned as righteousness.&rdquo; Here Paul cannot mean that God &ldquo;makes the ungodly to be righteous&rdquo; (by changing them internally and making them morally perfect), for then they would have merit or works of their own to depend on. Rather, he means that God declares the ungodly to be righteous in his sight, not on the basis of their good works, but in response to their faith.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The idea that justification is a legal declaration is quite evident also when justification is contrasted with condemnation. Paul says, &ldquo;Who shall bring any charge against God&rsquo;s elect? It is God who <span style="font-style:italic;">justifies;</span> who is to condemn?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.33-34">Rom. 8:33&ndash;34</a>). To &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; someone is to declare that person guilty. The opposite of condemnation is justification, which, in this context, must mean &ldquo;to declare someone not guilty.&rdquo; This is also evident from the fact that God&rsquo;s act of justifying is given as Paul&rsquo;s answer to the possibility of someone bringing an accusation or &ldquo;charge&rdquo; against God&rsquo;s people: such a declaration of guilt cannot stand in the face of God&rsquo;s declaration of righteousness.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some Old Testament examples of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">justify</span> (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">δικαιόω</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1467">G1467</a>) in the Septuagint, when translating the hiphil of <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">צָדַק</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK7405">H7405</a>, &ldquo;to justify&rdquo;) add support to this understanding. For example, we read of judges who &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">justify the righteous</span> and condemn the wicked&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt25.1">Deut. 25:1</a> NASB). Now in this case &ldquo;justify&rdquo; must mean &ldquo;declare to be righteous or not guilty,&rdquo; just as &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; means &ldquo;declare to be guilty.&rdquo; It would make no sense to say that &ldquo;justify&rdquo; here means &ldquo;to make someone to be good internally,&rdquo; for judges simply do not and cannot make people to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 724  </span>good on the inside. Nor does a judge&rsquo;s act of condemning the wicked make that person to be evil on the inside; it simply declares that the person is guilty with respect to the particular crime that has been brought before the court (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex23.7">Ex. 23:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki8.32">1 Kings 8:32</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ch6.23">2 Chron. 6:23</a>). Similarly, Job refuses to say that his comforters were right in what they said: &ldquo;Far be it from me that I should <span style="font-style:italic;">declare you right</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job27.5">Job 27:5</a> NASB, using the same Hebrew and Greek terms for &ldquo;justify&rdquo;). The same idea is found in Proverbs: &ldquo;He who <span style="font-style:italic;">justifies</span> the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr17.15">Prov. 17:15</a>). Here the idea of legal declaration is especially strong. Certainly it would not be an abomination to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> if &ldquo;justify&rdquo; meant &ldquo;to <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> someone good or righteous inside.&rdquo; In that case, to &ldquo;justify the wicked&rdquo; would be a very good thing in God&rsquo;s sight. But if &ldquo;justify&rdquo; means &ldquo;declare to be righteous,&rdquo; then it is perfectly clear why &ldquo;he who justifies the wicked&rdquo; is &ldquo;an abomination to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>.&rdquo; Similarly, Isaiah condemns those &ldquo;who <span style="font-style:italic;">justify</span> the wicked for a bribe&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is5.23">Isa. 5:23</a> NASB); again, &ldquo;justify&rdquo; must mean &ldquo;declare to be righteous&rdquo; (here used in the context of a legal declaration).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this sense of &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">declare</span> to be righteous&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">declare</span> to be not guilty&rdquo; Paul frequently uses the word to speak of God&rsquo;s justification of us, his declaration that we, though guilty sinners, are nonetheless righteous in his sight. It is important to emphasize that this legal declaration in itself does not change our internal nature or character at all. In this sense of &ldquo;justify,&rdquo; God issues a legal declaration about us. This is why theologians have also said that justification is <span style="font-style:italic;">forensic</span> where the word <span style="font-style:italic;">forensic</span> means &ldquo;having to do with legal proceedings.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		John Murray makes an important distinction between regeneration and justification:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Regeneration is an act of God in us; justification is a judgment of God with respect to us. The distinction is like that of the distinction between the act of a surgeon and the act of a judge. The surgeon, when he removes an inward cancer, does something in us. That is not what a judge does&mdash;he gives a verdict regarding our judicial status. If we are innocent he declares accordingly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The purity of the gospel is bound up with the recognition of this distinction. If justification is confused with regeneration or sanctification, then the door is opened for the perversion of the gospel at its center. Justification is still the article of the standing or falling of the Church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. God Declares Us to Be Just in His Sight</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In God&rsquo;s legal declaration of justification, he specifically declares that we are just <span style="font-style:italic;">in his sight</span>. This declaration involves two aspects. First, it means that he declares that we have no penalty to pay for sin, including past, present, and future sins. After a long discussion of justification by faith alone (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.1-5.21">Rom. 4:1&ndash;5:21</a>), and a parenthetical discussion on remaining sin in the Christian life, Paul returns to his main argument in the book of Romans and tells what is true of those who have been justified by faith: &ldquo;There is therefore now <span style="font-style:italic;">no condemnation</span> for those who are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>). In this sense those who are justified have no penalty to pay for sin. This means that we are not subject to any charge of guilt or <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 725  </span>condemnation: &ldquo;Who shall bring any charge against God&rsquo;s elect? It is God who <span style="font-style:italic;">justifies;</span> who is to condemn?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.33-34">Rom. 8:33&ndash;34</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The idea of full forgiveness of sins is prominent when Paul discusses justification by faith alone in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4">Romans 4</a>. Paul quotes David as pronouncing a blessing on one &ldquo;to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works.&rdquo; He then recalls how David said, &ldquo;Blessed are those <span style="font-style:italic;">whose iniquities are forgiven</span> and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.6-8">Rom. 4:6&ndash;8</a>). This justification therefore clearly involves the forgiveness of sins. David spoke similarly in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.12">Psalm 103:12</a>, &ldquo;As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us&rdquo; (cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.3">3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But if God merely declared us to be <span style="font-style:italic;">forgiven from our sins</span> that would not solve our problems entirely, for it would only make us morally neutral before God. We would be in the state that Adam was in before he had done anything right or wrong in God&rsquo;s sight&mdash;he was not guilty before God, but neither had he earned a record of righteousness before God. This first aspect of justification, in which God declares that our sins are forgiven, may be represented as in figure <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.5.36.1.2.1.0.0%3aFIG.36.1">36.1</a>, in which the minus signs represent sins on our account that are completely forgiven in justification.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, such a movement is not enough to earn us favor with God. We must rather move from a point of moral neutrality to a point of having positive righteousness before God, the righteousness of a life of perfect obedience to him. Our need may therefore be represented as in figure <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.5.36.1.2.2.0.0%3aFIG.36.2">36.2</a>, in which the plus signs indicate a record of righteousness before God.

		Therefore the second aspect of justification is that God must declare us not to be merely <span style="font-style:italic;">neutral</span> in his sight but actually to be <span style="font-style:italic;">righteous</span> in his sight. In fact, he must declare us to have the merits of perfect righteousness before him. The Old <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 726  </span>Testament sometimes spoke of God as giving such righteousness to his people even though they had not earned it themselves. Isaiah says, &ldquo;He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, <span style="font-style:italic;">he has covered me with the robe of righteousness</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is61.10">Isa. 61:10</a>). But Paul speaks more specifically about this in the New Testament. As a solution to our need for righteousness, Paul tells us that &ldquo;the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, <span style="font-style:italic;">the righteousness of God through faith in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Jesus Christ</span> for all who believe&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.21-22">Rom. 3:21&ndash;22</a>). He says, &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and <span style="font-style:italic;">it was reckoned to him as righteousness</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.3">Rom. 4:3</a>; quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge15.6">Gen. 15:6</a>). This came about through the obedience of Christ, for Paul says at the end of this extensive discussion of justification by faith that &ldquo;by one man&rsquo;s obedience many will be <span style="font-style:italic;">made righteous</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.19">Rom. 5:19</a>). The second aspect of God&rsquo;s declaration in justification, then, is that we have the merits of perfect righteousness before him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But questions arise: How can God declare that we have no penalty to pay for sin, and that we have the merits of perfect righteousness, if we are in fact guilty sinners? How can God declare us to be not guilty but righteous when in fact <span style="font-style:italic;">we are unrighteous?</span> These questions lead to our next point.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. God Can Declare Us to Be Just Because He Imputes Christ&rsquo;s Righteousness to Us</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we say that God <span style="font-style:italic;">imputes</span> Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to us it means that God <span style="font-style:italic;">thinks of</span> Christ&rsquo;s righteousness as belonging to us, or regards it <span style="font-style:italic;">as belonging to</span> us. He &ldquo;reckons&rdquo; it to our account. We read, &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and <span style="font-style:italic;">it was reckoned to him as righteousness</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.3">Rom. 4:3</a>, quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge15.6">Gen. 15:6</a>). Paul explains, &ldquo;To one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith <span style="font-style:italic;">is reckoned</span> as righteousness. So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom <span style="font-style:italic;">God reckons righteousness</span> apart from works&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.6">Rom. 4:6</a>). In this way, Christ&rsquo;s righteousness became ours. Paul says that we are those who received &ldquo;the free gift of righteousness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.17">Rom. 5:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is the third time in studying the doctrines of Scripture that we have encountered the idea of <span style="font-style:italic;">imputing</span> guilt or righteousness to someone else. First, when Adam sinned, his guilt was imputed to us; God the Father viewed it as belonging to us, and therefore it did. Second, when Christ suffered and died for our sins, our sin was <span style="font-style:italic;">imputed</span> to Christ; God thought of it as belonging to him, and he paid the penalty for it. Now in the doctrine of justification we see imputation for the third time. Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is <span style="font-style:italic;">imputed</span> to us, and therefore God <span style="font-style:italic;">thinks of it</span> as belonging to us. It is not our own righteousness but Christ&rsquo;s righteousness that is freely given to us. So Paul can say that God made Christ to be &ldquo;our wisdom, <span style="font-style:italic;">our righteousness</span> and sanctification and redemption&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.30">1 Cor. 1:30</a>). And Paul says that his goal is to be found in Christ, &ldquo;not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through faith in Christ, <span style="font-style:italic;">the righteousness from God</span> that depends on faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.9">Phil. 3:9</a>). Paul knows that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 727  </span>righteousness he has before God is not anything of his own doing; it is the righteousness of God that comes through Jesus Christ (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.21-22">Rom. 3:21&ndash;22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is essential to the heart of the gospel to insist that God declares us to be just or righteous not on the basis of our actual condition of righteousness or holiness, but rather on the basis of Christ&rsquo;s perfect righteousness, which he thinks of as belonging to us. This was the heart of the difference between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism at the Reformation. Protestantism since the time of Martin Luther has insisted that justification does <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> change us internally and it is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> a declaration based in any way on any goodness that we have in ourselves. If justification changed us internally and then declared us to be righteous based on how good we actually were, then (1) we could never be declared perfectly righteous in this life, because there is always sin that remains in our lives, and (2) there would be no provision for forgiveness of past sins (committed before we were changed internally), and therefore we could never have confidence that we are right before God. We would lose the confidence that Paul has when he says, &ldquo;Therefore, <span style="font-style:italic;">since we are justified by faith</span> we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.1">Rom. 5:1</a>). If we thought of justification as based on something that we are internally we would never have the confidence to say with Paul, &ldquo;There is therefore now <span style="font-style:italic;">no condemnation</span> for those who are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>). We would have no assurance of forgiveness with God, no confidence to draw near to him &ldquo;with a true heart in full assurance of faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.22">Heb. 10:22</a>). We would not be able to speak of &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">free gift</span> of righteousness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.17">Rom. 5:17</a>), or say that &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">free gift</span> of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.23">Rom. 6:23</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The traditional Roman Catholic understanding of justification is very different from this. The Roman Catholic Church understands justification as something that changes us internally and makes us more holy within. &ldquo;According to the teaching of the Council of Trent, justification is &ldquo;sanctifying and renewing of the inner man.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; In order for justification to begin, one must first be baptized and <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 728  </span>then (as an adult) continue to have faith: &ldquo;The instrumental cause … of the first justification is the Sacrament of Baptism.&rdquo; But &ldquo;the justification of an adult is not possible without Faith … As far as the content of justifying faith is concerned, the so-called fiducial faith does not suffice. What is demanded is theological or dogmatic faith (confessional faith) which consists in the firm acceptance of the Divine truths of Revelation.&rdquo; Thus baptism is the means by which justification is first obtained, and then faith is necessary if an adult is to receive justification or to continue in the state of justification. Ott explains that &ldquo;the so-called fiduciary faith&rdquo; is not enough&mdash;meaning that the faith that simply trusts in Christ for forgiveness of sins is not enough. It must be a faith that accepts the content of the teaching of the Catholic Church, &ldquo;theological or dogmatic faith.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Roman Catholic view may be said to understand justification as based not on <span style="font-style:italic;">imputed</span> righteousness but on <span style="font-style:italic;">infused</span> righteousness&mdash;that is, righteousness that God actually <span style="font-style:italic;">puts into us</span> and that changes us internally and in terms of our actual moral character. Then he gives us varying measures of justification according to the measure of righteousness that has been infused or placed within us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The result of this Roman Catholic view of justification is that people cannot be sure if they are in a &ldquo;state of grace&rdquo; where they experience God&rsquo;s complete acceptance and favor. The Catholic Church teaches that people cannot be certain that they are in this &ldquo;state of grace&rdquo; unless they receive a special revelation from God to this effect. The Council of Trent declared,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If one considers his own weakness and his defective disposition, he may well be fearful and anxious as to the state of grace, as nobody knows with the certainty of faith, which permits of no error, that he has achieved the grace of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To this statement Ott adds the comment,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The reason for the uncertainty of the state of grace lies in this, that without a special revelation nobody can with certainty of faith know whether or not he has fulfilled all the conditions which are necessary for the achieving of justification. The impossibility of the certainty of faith, however, by no means excludes a high moral certainty supported by the testimony of conscience.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, since the Roman Catholic Church views justification as including something that God does within us, it follows that people can experience varying degrees of justification. We read, &ldquo;The degree of justifying grace is not identical in all the just&rdquo; and &ldquo;grace can be increased by good works.&rdquo; Ott explains how this Catholic view differs from that of the Protestant Reformers: &ldquo;As the Reformers wrongly regarded justification as a merely external imputation of Christ&rsquo;s justice, they were obliged also to hold that justification is identical in all men. The Council of Trent, however, declared that the measure of the grace of justification received varies in the individual person who is justified, according to the measure of God&rsquo;s free distribution and to the disposition and the co-operation of the recipient himself.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 729  </span>Finally, the logical consequence of this view of justification is that our eternal life with God is not based on God&rsquo;s grace alone, but partially on our merit as well: &ldquo;For the justified eternal life is both a gift of grace promised by God and a reward for his own good works and merits … Salutary works are, at the same time, gifts of God and meritorious acts of man.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To support this view of justification from Scripture, Ott repeatedly mingles passages from the New Testament that talk not only of justification, but also of many other aspects of the Christian life, such as regeneration (which God works in us), sanctification (which is a process in the Christian life and which of course does vary from individual to individual), the possession and use of various spiritual gifts in the Christian life (which differ from individual to individual) and eternal reward (which also varies according to the individual). To classify all of these passages under the category of &ldquo;justification&rdquo; only blurs the issue and ultimately makes forgiveness of sins and right legal standing before God a matter of our own merit, not a free gift from God. Therefore, this blurring of distinctions ultimately destroys the heart of the gospel.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		That is what Martin Luther so clearly saw and that is what gave such motivation to the Reformation. When the good news of the gospel truly became the good news of totally free salvation in Jesus Christ, then it spread like wildfire throughout the civilized world. But this was simply a recovery of the original gospel, which declares, &ldquo;The wages of sin is death, but the <span style="font-style:italic;">free gift of God</span> is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.23">Rom. 6:23</a>), and insists that &ldquo;There is therefore now <span style="font-style:italic;">no condemnation</span> for those who are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. Justification Comes to Us Entirely by God&rsquo;s Grace, Not on Account of Any Merit in Ourselves</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		After Paul explains in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.18-3.20">Romans 1:18&ndash;3:20</a> that no one will ever be able to make himself righteous before God (&ldquo;For no human being will be justified in his sight by works of the law,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.20">Rom. 3:20</a>), then Paul goes on to explain that &ldquo;since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, they are justified <span style="font-style:italic;">by his grace as a gift</span> through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.23-24">Rom. 3:23&ndash;24</a>). God&rsquo;s &ldquo;grace&rdquo; means his &ldquo;unmerited favor.&rdquo; Because we are completely unable to earn favor with God, the only way we could be declared righteous is if God freely provides salvation for us by grace, totally apart from our work. Paul explains, &ldquo;For <span style="font-style:italic;">by grace</span> you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God&mdash;not because of works, lest any man should boast&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.8-9">Eph. 2:8&ndash;9</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt3.7">Titus 3:7</a>). Grace is clearly put in contrast to works or merit as the reason why God is willing to justify us. God did not have any obligation to impute our sin to Christ or to impute Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to us; it was only because of his unmerited favor that he did this.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In distinction from the Roman Catholic teaching that we are justified by God&rsquo;s grace <span style="font-style:italic;">plus some merit of our own</span> as we make ourselves fit to receive the grace of justification and as we grow in this state of grace through our good works, Luther and the other Reformers insisted that justification comes by grace <span style="font-style:italic;">alone</span> not by grace plus some merit on our part.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we began this chapter we noted that justification comes after saving faith. Paul makes this sequence clear when he says, &ldquo;We have believed in Christ Jesus, <span style="font-style:italic;">in order to be justified</span> by faith in Christ, and not by works of the law, because by works of the law shall no one be justified&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.16">Gal. 2:16</a>). Here Paul indicates that faith comes first and it is for the purpose of being justified. He also says that Christ is &ldquo;to be received by faith&rdquo; and that God &ldquo;justifies him who has <span style="font-style:italic;">faith</span> in Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.25">Rom. 3:25</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.26">26</a>). The entire chapter of <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4">Romans 4</a> is a defense of the fact that we are justified by faith, not by works, just as Abraham and David themselves were. Paul says, &ldquo;We are justified <span style="font-style:italic;">by faith</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.1">Rom. 5:1</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture never says that we are justified because of the inherent goodness of our faith, as if our faith has merit before God. It never allows us to think that our faith in itself earns favor with God. Rather, Scripture says that we are justified &ldquo;by means of&rdquo; our faith, understanding faith to be the instrument through which justification is given to us, but not at all an activity that earns us merit or favor with God. Rather, we are justified solely because of the merits of Christ&rsquo;s work (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.17-19">Rom. 5:17&ndash;19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But we may ask why God chose <span style="font-style:italic;">faith</span> to be the attitude of heart by which we would obtain justification. Why could God not have decided to give justification to all those who sincerely show love? Or who show joy? Or contentment? Or humility? Or wisdom? Why did God choose <span style="font-style:italic;">faith</span> as the means by which we receive justification?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is apparently because <span style="font-style:italic;">faith</span> is the one attitude of heart that is the exact opposite of depending on ourselves. When we come to Christ in faith we essentially say, &ldquo;I give up! I will not depend on myself or my own good works any longer. I know that I can never make myself righteous before God. Therefore, Jesus, I trust you and depend on you completely to give me a righteous standing before God.&rdquo; In this way, faith is the exact opposite of trusting in ourselves, and therefore it is the attitude that perfectly fits salvation that depends not at all on our own merit but entirely on God&rsquo;s free gift of grace. Paul explains this when he says, &ldquo;That is why it depends <span style="font-style:italic;">on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace</span> and be guaranteed to all his descendants&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.16">Rom. 4:16</a>). This is why the Reformers from Martin Luther on were so firm in their insistence that justification comes not through faith plus some merit or good work on our part, but only <span style="font-style:italic;">through faith alone</span>. &ldquo;For by grace you have been saved <span style="font-style:italic;">through faith;</span> and this is not your own <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 731  </span>doing, it is the gift of God&mdash;not because of works, lest any man should boast&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.8-9">Eph. 2:8&ndash;9</a>). Paul repeatedly says that &ldquo;no human being will be justified in his sight by works of law&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.20">Rom. 3:20</a>); the same idea is repeated in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.16">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.11">3:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.4">5:4</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But is this consistent with the epistle of James? What can James mean when he says, &ldquo;You see that a man is <span style="font-style:italic;">justified by works</span> and not by faith alone&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.24">James 2:24</a>). Here we must realize that James is using the word <span style="font-style:italic;">justified</span> in a different sense from the way Paul uses it. In the beginning of this chapter we noted that the word <span style="font-style:italic;">justify</span> has a range of meanings, and that one significant sense was &ldquo;declare to be righteous,&rdquo; but we should also notice that the Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">δικαιόω</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1467">G1467</a>) can also mean &ldquo;demonstrate or show to be righteous.&rdquo; For instance, Jesus said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;You are those who <span style="font-style:italic;">justify</span> yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.15">Luke 16:15</a>). The point here was not that the Pharisees went around making legal declarations that they were &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; before God, but rather that they were always attempting to <span style="font-style:italic;">show others</span> that they were righteous by their outward deeds. Jesus knew that the truth was otherwise: &ldquo;But God knows your hearts&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.15">Luke 16:15</a>). Similarly, the lawyer who put Jesus to a test by asking what he should do to inherit eternal life answered Jesus&rsquo; first question well. But when Jesus told him, &ldquo;Do this, and you will live,&rdquo; he was not satisfied. Luke tells us, &ldquo;But he, <span style="font-style:italic;">desiring to justify himself</span> said to Jesus, &ldquo;And who is my neighbor?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk10.28-29">Luke 10:28&ndash;29</a>). Now he was not desiring to give a legal pronouncement about himself that he was not guilty in God&rsquo;s sight; rather, he was desiring to &ldquo;show himself righteous&rdquo; before others who were listening. Other examples of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">justify</span> meaning &ldquo;show to be righteous&rdquo; can be found in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.19">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk7.35">Luke 7:35</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.4">Romans 3:4</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Our interpretation of <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2">James 2</a> depends not only on the fact that &ldquo;show to be righteous&rdquo; is an acceptable sense for the word <span style="font-style:italic;">justified</span> but also on the consideration that this sense fits well in the context of <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2">James 2</a>. When James says, &ldquo;Was not Abraham our father <span style="font-style:italic;">justified by works</span> when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.21">21</a>) he is referring to something later in Abraham&rsquo;s life, the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, which occurred in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge22">Genesis 22</a>. This is long after the time recorded in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge15.6">Genesis 15:6</a> where Abraham believed God &ldquo;and he reckoned it to him as righteousness.&rdquo; Yet this earlier incident at the beginning of Abraham&rsquo;s covenantal relationship with God is the one that Paul quotes and repeatedly refers to in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4">Romans 4</a>. Paul is talking about the time God justified Abraham once for all, reckoning righteousness to him as a result of his faith in God. But James is talking about something far later, after Abraham had waited many years for the birth of Isaac, and then after Isaac had grown old enough to carry wood up the mountain for a sacrifice. At that point Abraham was &ldquo;shown to be righteous&rdquo; by his works, and in that sense James says that Abraham was &ldquo;justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.21">James 2:21</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The larger concern of James in this section also fits this understanding. James is concerned to show that mere intellectual agreement with the gospel is a &ldquo;faith&rdquo; that is really no faith at all. He is concerned to argue against those who say they have faith but show no change in their lives. He says, &ldquo;Show me your faith apart <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 732  </span>from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.18">James 2:18</a>). &ldquo;For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.26">James 2:26</a>). James is simply saying here that &ldquo;faith&rdquo; that has no results or &ldquo;works&rdquo; is not real faith at all; it is &ldquo;dead&rdquo; faith. He is not denying Paul&rsquo;s clear teaching that justification (in the sense of a declaration of right legal standing before God) is by faith alone apart from works of the law; he is simply affirming a different truth, namely, that &ldquo;justification&rdquo; in the sense of an outward showing that one is righteous only occurs as we see evidence in a person&rsquo;s life. To paraphrase, James is saying that a person is &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">shown to be righteous</span> by his works, and not by his faith alone.&rdquo; This is something with which Paul also would certainly agree (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co13.5">2 Cor. 13:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.19-24">Gal. 5:19&ndash;24</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The practical implications of the doctrine of justification by faith alone are very significant. First, this doctrine enables us to offer genuine <span style="font-style:italic;">hope</span> to unbelievers who know they could never make themselves righteous before God: if salvation is a free gift to be received through faith <span style="font-style:italic;">alone</span> then anyone who hears the gospel may hope that eternal life is freely offered and may be obtained.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Second, this doctrine gives us confidence that God will never make us pay the penalty for sins that have been forgiven on Christ&rsquo;s merits. Of course, we may continue to suffer the ordinary <span style="font-style:italic;">consequences</span> of sin (an alcoholic who quits drinking may still have physical weakness for the rest of his or her life, and a thief who is justified may still have to go to jail to pay the penalty for his or her crime). Moreover, God may <span style="font-style:italic;">discipline</span> us if we continue to act in ways that are disobedient to him (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.5-11">Heb. 12:5&ndash;11</a>), doing this out of love and for our own good. But God can never nor will ever <span style="font-style:italic;">take vengeance</span> on us for past sins or <span style="font-style:italic;">make us pay the penalty</span> that is due for them or <span style="font-style:italic;">punish us out of wrath</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">for the purpose of doing us harm</span>. &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom 8:1</a>). This fact should give us a great sense of joy and confidence before God that we are accepted by him and that we stand before him as &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; and &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; forever.

		 1. Are you confident that God has declared you &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; forever in his sight? Do you know when that happened in your own life? Did you do or think anything that resulted in God&rsquo;s justifying of you? Did you do anything to deserve justification? If you are not sure that God has justified you fully and for all time, is there something you need to do before that will happen? What would persuade you that God has certainly justified you?

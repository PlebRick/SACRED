		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Introduction to the Study of God&rsquo;s Character</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Classifying God&rsquo;s Attributes</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When we come to talk about the character of God, we realize that we cannot say everything the Bible teaches us about God&rsquo;s character at once. We need some way to decide which aspect of God&rsquo;s character to discuss first, which aspect to discuss second, and so forth. In other words, we need some way to categorize the attributes of God. This question is not as unimportant as it may seem. There is the possibility that we would adopt a misleading order of attributes or that we would emphasize some attributes so much that others would not be presented properly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Several different methods of classifying God&rsquo;s attributes have been used. In this chapter we will adopt probably the most commonly used classification: the <span style="font-style:italic;">incommunicable attributes</span> of God (that is, those attributes that God does not share or &ldquo;communicate&rdquo; to others) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">communicable attributes</span> of God (those God shares or &ldquo;communicates&rdquo; with us).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Examples of the incommunicable attributes would be God&rsquo;s eternity (God has existed for all eternity, but we have not), unchangeableness (God does not change, but we do), or omnipresence (God is everywhere present, but we are present only in one place at one time). Examples of the communicable attributes would be love (God is love, and we are able to love as well), knowledge (God has knowledge, and we are able to have knowledge as well), mercy (God is merciful, and we are able to be merciful too), or justice (God is just and we, too, are able to be just). This classification of God&rsquo;s attributes into two major categories is helpful, and most people have an initial sense of which specific attributes should be called incommunicable and which should be called communicable. Thus it makes sense to say that God&rsquo;s love is communicable but his omnipresence is not.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, upon further reflection we realize that this distinction, although helpful, is not perfect. That is because there is no attribute of God that is <span style="font-style:italic;">completely</span> communicable, and there is no attribute of God that is <span style="font-style:italic;">completely</span> incommunicable! This will be evident if we think for a moment about some things we already know about God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For example, God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">wisdom</span> would usually be called a communicable attribute, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 157  </span>because we also can be wise. But we will never be infinitely wise as God is. His wisdom is <span style="font-style:italic;">to some extent</span> shared with us, but it is never <span style="font-style:italic;">fully</span> shared with us. Similarly, we can share God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">knowledge</span> in part, yet we shall never share it fully, for God&rsquo;s thoughts are higher than ours &ldquo;as the heavens are higher than the earth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is55.9">Isa. 55:9</a>). We can imitate God&rsquo;s love and share in that attribute to some degree, but we will never be infinitely loving as God is. So it is with all the attributes that are normally called &ldquo;communicable attributes&rdquo;: God does indeed share them with us <span style="font-style:italic;">to some degree</span> but none of these attributes is completely communicable. It is better to say that those attributes we call &ldquo;communicable&rdquo; are those that are <span style="font-style:italic;">more shared</span> with us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Those attributes we call &ldquo;incommunicable&rdquo; are better defined by saying that they are attributes of God that are <span style="font-style:italic;">less shared</span> by us. Not one of the incommunicable attributes of God is completely without some likeness in the character of human beings. For example, God is unchangeable, while we change. But we do not change completely, for there are some aspects of our characters that remain largely unchanged: our individual identities, many of our personality traits, and some of our long-term purposes remain substantially unchanged over many years (and will remain largely unchanged once we are set free from sin and begin to live in God&rsquo;s presence forever).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, God is eternal, and we are subject to the limitations of time. However, we see <span style="font-style:italic;">some</span> reflection of God&rsquo;s eternity in the fact that we will live with him forever and enjoy eternal life, as well as in the fact that we have the ability to remember the past and to have a strong sense of awareness of the future (unlike much of God&rsquo;s creation; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ec3.11">Eccl. 3:11</a>). God&rsquo;s attributes of independence and omnipresence are perhaps those that are least easy to see reflected in our own natures, but even these can be seen to be faintly reflected in us when we compare ourselves with much of the rest of God&rsquo;s creation: as we grow to adulthood we attain some degree of independence from others for our existence; and, though we cannot be at more than one place at one time, we have the ability to act in ways that have effects in many different places at once (this again sets us apart from most of the rest of creation).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We will use the two categories of &ldquo;incommunicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;communicable&rdquo; attributes then, while realizing that they are not entirely precise classifications, and that there is in reality much overlap between the categories.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">. The Names of God in Scripture</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In the Bible a person&rsquo;s name is a description of his or her character. Likewise, the names of God in Scripture are various descriptions of his character. In a broad sense, then, God&rsquo;s &ldquo;name&rdquo; is equal to all that the Bible and creation tell us about God. When we pray, &ldquo;Hallowed be your <span style="font-style:italic;">name</span>&rdquo; as part of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.9">Matt. 6:9</a>), we are praying that people would speak about God in a way that is honoring to him and that accurately reflects his character. This honoring of God&rsquo;s name can be done with actions as well as words, for our actions reflect the character of the Creator whom we serve (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.16">Matt. 5:16</a>). To honor God&rsquo;s name is therefore to honor him. The command, &ldquo;You shall not take the <span style="font-style:italic;">name</span> of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> your God in vain&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex20.7">Ex. 20:7</a>) is a command that we not dishonor God&rsquo;s reputation either by words that speak of him in a foolish or misleading way, or by actions that do not reflect his true character.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 158  </span>Now the Bible does give many individual names to God, all of which reflect some true aspect of his character. Many of these names are taken from human experience or emotions in order to describe parts of God&rsquo;s character, while many other names are taken from the rest of the natural creation. In a sense, all of these expressions of God&rsquo;s character in terms of things found in the universe are &ldquo;names&rdquo; of God because they tell us something true about him.

		Herman Bavinck, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Doctrine of God</span> gives a long list of such descriptions of God taken from creation: God is compared to a lion (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is31.4">Isa. 31:4</a>), an eagle (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt32.11">Deut. 32:11</a>), a lamb (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.7">Isa. 53:7</a>), a hen (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt23.37">Matt. 23:37</a>), the sun (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps84.11">Ps. 84:11</a>), the morning star (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.16">Rev. 22:16</a>), a light (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps27.1">Ps. 27:1</a>), a torch (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.23">Rev. 21:23</a>), a fire (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.29">Heb. 12:29</a>), a fountain (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps36.9">Ps. 36:9</a>), a rock (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt32.4">Deut. 32:4</a>), a hiding place (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps119.114">Ps. 119:114</a>), a tower (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr18.10">Prov. 18:10</a>), a shadow (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps91.1">Ps. 91:1</a>), a shield (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps84.11">Ps. 84:11</a>), a temple (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.22">Rev. 21:22</a>), and so forth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Taken from human experience, Bavinck finds an even more extensive list, which is reproduced here only in part: God is called bridegroom (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is61.10">Isa. 61:10</a>), husband (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is54.5">Isa. 54:5</a>), father (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt32.6">Deut. 32:6</a>), judge and king (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is33.22">Isa. 33:22</a>), man of war (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex15.3">Ex. 15:3</a>), builder and maker (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11.10">Heb. 11:10</a>), shepherd (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps23.1">Ps. 23:1</a>), physician (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex15.26">Ex. 15:26</a>), and so forth. Furthermore, God is spoken of in terms of human actions such as knowing (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge18.21">Gen. 18:21</a>), remembering (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge8.1">Gen. 8:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex2.24">Ex. 2:24</a>), seeing (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.10">Gen. 1:10</a>), hearing (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex2.24">Ex. 2:24</a>), smelling (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge8.21">Gen. 8:21</a>), tasting (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps11.5">Ps. 11:5</a>), sitting (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps9.7">Ps. 9:7</a>), rising (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps68.1">Ps. 68:1</a>), walking (<a href="https://ref.ly/Le26.12">Lev. 26:12</a>), wiping away tears (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is25.8">Isa. 25:8</a>), and so forth. Human emotions are attributed to God, such as joy (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is62.5">Isa. 62:5</a>), grief (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps78.40">Ps. 78:40</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is63.10">Isa. 63:10</a>), anger (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je7.18-19">Jer. 7:18&ndash;19</a>), love (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.16">John 3:16</a>), hatred (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt16.22">Deut. 16:22</a>), wrath (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps2.5">Ps. 2:5</a>), and so forth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Even though God does not have a physical body, Scripture uses various parts of the human body to describe God&rsquo;s activities in a metaphorical way. Scripture can speak of God&rsquo;s face or countenance (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex33.20">Ex. 33:20</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex33.23">23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is63.9">Isa. 63:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps16.11">Ps. 16:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.4">Rev. 22:4</a>), eyes (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps11.4">Ps. 11:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.13">Heb. 4:13</a>), eyelids (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps11.4">Ps. 11:4</a>), ears (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps55.1">Ps. 55:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is59.1">Isa. 59:1</a>), nose (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt33.10">Deut. 33:10</a>), mouth (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt8.3">Deut. 8:3</a>), lips (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job11.5">Job 11:5</a>), tongue (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is30.27">Isa. 30:27</a>), neck (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je18.17">Jer. 18:17</a>), arms (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex15.16">Ex. 15:16</a>), hand (<a href="https://ref.ly/Nu11.23">Num. 11:23</a>), finger (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex8.19">Ex. 8:19</a>), heart (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge6.6">Gen. 6:6</a>), foot (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is66.1">Isa. 66:1</a>), and so forth. Even terms describing personal characteristics such as good, merciful, gracious, righteous, holy, just, and many more, are terms whose meaning is familiar to us through an experience of these qualities in other human beings. And even those terms that seem least related to creation, such as eternity or unchangeableness, are understood by us not intuitively but by negating concepts that we know from our experience (eternity is not being limited by time and unchangeableness is not changing).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The point of collecting all these passages is to show, first, that in one sense or another <span style="font-style:italic;">all of creation reveals something about God to us</span> and that the higher creation, especially man who is made in God&rsquo;s image, reveals him more fully.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The second reason for mentioning this long list is to show that all that we know about God from Scripture comes to us in terms that we understand because they <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 159  </span>describe events or things common to human experience. Using a more technical term, we can say that <span style="font-style:italic;">all that Scripture says about God uses anthropomorphic</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> language&mdash;that is, language that speaks of God in human terms</span>. Sometimes people have been troubled by the fact that there is anthropomorphic language in Scripture. But this should not be troubling to us, for, if God is going to teach us about things we do not know by direct experience (such as his attributes), he has to teach us in terms of what we do know. This is why all that Scripture says about God is &ldquo;anthropomorphic&rdquo; in a broad sense (speaking of God either in human terms or in terms of the creation we know). This fact does not mean that Scripture gives us wrong or misleading ideas about God, for this is the way that God has chosen to reveal himself to us, and to reveal himself truly and accurately. Nonetheless, it should caution us not to take any one of these descriptions by itself and isolate it from its immediate context or from the rest of what Scripture says about God. If we did that, we would run the risk of misunderstanding or of having an imbalanced or inadequate picture of who God is. Each description of one of God&rsquo;s attributes must be understood in the light of everything else that Scripture tells us about God. If we fail to remember this, we will inevitably understand God&rsquo;s character wrongly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For example, we have an <span style="font-style:italic;">idea</span> of love from human experience. That helps us to understand what Scripture means when it says that God is love, but our understanding of the meaning of &ldquo;love&rdquo; when applied to God is not identical with our experience of love in human relationships. So we must learn from observing how God acts in all of Scripture and from the other attributes of God that are given in Scripture, as well as from our own real-life experiences of God&rsquo;s love, if we are to refine our idea of God&rsquo;s love in an appropriate way and avoid misunderstanding. Thus, anthropomorphic language about God is <span style="font-style:italic;">true</span> when it occurs in Scripture, but it can be understood rightly only by continual reading of Scripture throughout our lives in order that we may understand this language in the context of all of Scripture.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There is yet a third reason for pointing out the great diversity of descriptions about God taken from human experience and from the natural world. This language should remind us that <span style="font-style:italic;">God made the universe so that it would show forth the excellence of his character</span> that is, that it would show forth his glory. God is worthy to receive glory because he created all things (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.11">Rev. 4:11</a>); therefore, all things should honor him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps148">Psalm 148</a> is an example of all creation being summoned to give praise to God:

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As we learn about God&rsquo;s character from Scripture, it should open our eyes and enable us to interpret creation rightly. As a result, we will be able to see reflections of the excellence of God&rsquo;s character everywhere in creation: &ldquo;the whole earth is full of his glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is6.3">Isa. 6:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It must be remembered that though all that Scripture tells us about God is true, it is not exhaustive. Scripture does not tell us everything about God&rsquo;s character. Thus, we will never know God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">full or complete &ldquo;name</span>&rdquo; in the sense that we will never understand God&rsquo;s character exhaustively. We will never know all there is to know about God. For this reason theologians have sometimes said, &ldquo;God has many names, yet God has no name.&rdquo; God has many names in that we know many true descriptions of his character from Scripture, but God has no name in that we will never be able to describe or understand all of his character.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Balanced Definitions of God&rsquo;s Incommunicable Attributes</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The incommunicable attributes of God are perhaps the most easily misunderstood, probably because they represent aspects of God&rsquo;s character that are least familiar to our experience. In this chapter, therefore, each of the incommunicable attributes of God is defined with a two-part sentence. The first part defines the attribute under discussion, and the second part guards against misunderstanding the attribute by stating a balancing or opposite aspect that relates to that attribute. For example, God&rsquo;s unchangeableness is defined as follows: &ldquo;God is unchanging in his being, perfections, purposes, and promises, <span style="font-style:italic;">yet</span> God does act, and he acts differently in response to different situations.&rdquo; The second half of the sentence guards against the idea that unchangeableness means inability to act at all. Some people do understand unchangeableness in this way, but such an understanding is inconsistent with the biblical presentation of God&rsquo;s unchangeableness.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Independence</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> God&rsquo;s independence is defined as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">God does not need us or the rest of creation for anything, yet we and the rest of creation can glorify him and bring him joy</span>. This attribute of God is sometimes called his self-existence or his <span style="font-style:italic;">aseity</span> (from the Latin words <span style="font-style:italic;" lang="la">a se</span> which mean &ldquo;from himself&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture in several places teaches that God does not need any part of creation in order to exist or for any other reason. God is absolutely independent and self-sufficient. Paul proclaims to the men of Athens, &ldquo;The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 161  </span>by man, <span style="font-style:italic;">nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything</span> since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.24-25">Acts 17:24&ndash;25</a>). The implication is that God does not need anything from mankind.

		God asks Job, &ldquo;Who has given to me, that I should repay him? <span style="font-style:italic;">Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job41.11">Job 41:11</a>). No one has ever contributed to God anything that did not first come from God who created all things. Similarly, we read God&rsquo;s word in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps50">Psalm 50</a>, &ldquo;every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the birds of the air, and all that moves in the field is mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for <span style="font-style:italic;">the world and all that is in it is mine</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps50.10-12">Ps. 50:10&ndash;12</a>).

		People have sometimes thought that God created human beings because he was lonely and needed fellowship with other persons. If this were true, it would certainly mean that God is not completely independent of creation. It would mean that God would <span style="font-style:italic;">need</span> to create persons in order to be completely happy or completely fulfilled in his personal existence.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet there are some specific indications in Jesus&rsquo; words that show this idea to be inaccurate. In <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.5">John 17:5</a>, Jesus prays, &ldquo;Father, glorify me in your own presence with <span style="font-style:italic;">the glory which I had with you before the world was made.</span>&rdquo; Here is an indication that there was a sharing of glory between the Father and the Son before creation. Then in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.24">John 17:24</a>, Jesus speaks to the Father of &ldquo;my glory which you have given me <span style="font-style:italic;">in your love for me before the foundation of the world.</span>&rdquo; There was love and communication between the Father and the Son before creation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These passages indicate explicitly what we can learn elsewhere from the doctrine of the Trinity, namely, that among the persons of the Trinity there has been perfect love and fellowship and communication for all eternity. The fact that God is three persons yet one God means that there was no loneliness or lack of personal fellowship on God&rsquo;s part before creation. In fact, the love and interpersonal fellowship, and the sharing of glory, have always been and will always be far more perfect than any communion we as finite human beings will ever have with God. And as the second verse quoted above speaks of the glory the Father gave to the Son, we should also realize that there is a giving of glory by the members of the Trinity to one another that far surpasses any bestowal of glory that could ever be given to God by all creation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With regard to God&rsquo;s existence, this doctrine also reminds us that only God exists by virtue of his very nature, and that he was never created and never came into being. He always was. This is seen from the fact that all things that exist were made by him (&ldquo;For you created <span style="font-style:italic;">all things</span> and by your will they existed and were created&rdquo; [<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.11">Rev. 4:11</a>]; this is also affirmed in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.3">John 1:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.35-36">Rom. 11:35&ndash;36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.6">1 Cor. 8:6</a>). Moses tells us that God existed before there was any creation: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Before</span> the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting <span style="font-style:italic;">you are God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps90.2">Ps. 90:2</a>). God&rsquo;s independence is also seen in his self-designation in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex3.14">Exodus 3:14</a>: &ldquo;God said to Moses, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I AM WHO I AM.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</span> It is also possible to translate this statement &ldquo;I will be what I will be,&rdquo; but in both cases the implication is that God&rsquo;s existence and character are determined by himself alone and are not dependent on anyone or anything else. This means that God&rsquo;s being has always been and will always be exactly what it is. God is not dependent upon any part of creation for his existence or his nature. Without <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 162  </span>creation, God would still be infinitely loving, infinitely just, eternal, omniscient, trinitarian, and so forth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God&rsquo;s being is also something totally unique. It is not just that God <span style="font-style:italic;">does not</span> need the creation for anything; God <span style="font-style:italic;">could not</span> need the creation for anything. The difference between the creature and the Creator is an immensely vast difference, for God exists in a fundamentally different order of being. It is not just that we exist and God has always existed; it is also that God <span style="font-style:italic;">necessarily</span> exists in an infinitely better, stronger, more excellent way. The difference between God&rsquo;s being and ours is more than the difference between the sun and a candle, more than the difference between the ocean and a raindrop, more than the difference between the arctic ice cap and a snowflake, more than the difference between the universe and the room we are sitting in: God&rsquo;s being is <span style="font-style:italic;">qualitatively different</span>. No limitation or imperfection in creation should be projected onto our thought of God. He is the Creator; all else is creaturely. All else can pass away in an instant; he <span style="font-style:italic;">necessarily exists</span> forever.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The balancing consideration with respect to this doctrine is the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">we and the rest of creation can glorify God and bring him joy</span>. This must be stated in order to guard against any idea that God&rsquo;s independence makes us meaningless. Someone might wonder, if God does not need us for anything, then are we important at all? Is there any significance to our existence or to the existence of the rest of creation? In response it must be said that we are in fact very meaningful because God has created us and he has determined that we would be <span style="font-style:italic;">meaningful to him</span>. That is the final definition of genuine significance.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God speaks of his sons and daughters from the ends of the earth as &ldquo;every one who is called by my name, whom I created <span style="font-style:italic;">for my glory</span> whom I formed and made&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.7">Isa. 43:7</a>). Although God did not have to create us, he chose to do so in a totally free choice. He decided that he would create us to glorify him (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.11-12">Eph. 1:11&ndash;12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.11">Rev. 4:11</a>).

		It is also true that we are able to bring real joy and delight to God. It is one of the most amazing facts in Scripture that God actually delights in his people and rejoices over them. Isaiah prophesies about the restoration of God&rsquo;s people:

God does not need us for anything, yet it is the amazing fact of our existence that he chooses to delight in us and to allow us to bring joy to his heart. This is the basis for personal significance in the lives of all <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 163  </span>God&rsquo;s people: to be significant to God is to be significant in the most ultimate sense.

		The definition given above specifies that God is unchanging&mdash;not in every way that we might imagine, but only in ways that Scripture itself affirms. The Scripture passages already cited refer either to God&rsquo;s own being or to some attribute of his character. From these we can conclude that God is unchanging, at least with respect to his &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">being,</span>&rdquo; and with respect to his &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">perfections</span>&rdquo; (that is, his attributes or the various aspects of his character).

The contrast between being and becoming marks the difference between the Creator and the creature. Every creature is continually becoming. It is changeable, constantly striving, seeks rest and satisfaction, and finds this rest in God, in him alone, for only he is pure being and no becoming. Hence, in Scripture God is often called the Rock.…

		The definition given above also affirms God&rsquo;s unchangeableness or immutability with respect to his <span style="font-style:italic;">purposes</span>. &ldquo;The counsel of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps33.11">Ps. 33:11</a>). This general statement about God&rsquo;s counsel is supported by several specific verses that talk about individual plans or purposes of God that he has had for all eternity (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt13.35">Matt. 13:35</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.34">25:34</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.4">Eph. 1:4</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.11">11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.9">3:9</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.11">11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti2.19">2 Tim. 2:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.20">1 Peter 1:20</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re13.8">Rev. 13:8</a>). Once God has determined that he will assuredly bring something about, his purpose is unchanging, and it will be achieved. In fact, God claims through Isaiah that no one else is like him in this regard:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">

		Furthermore, God is unchanging in his <span style="font-style:italic;">promises</span>. Once he has promised something, he will not be unfaithful to that promise: &ldquo;God is not a man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfil it?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Nu23.19">Num. 23:19</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa15.29">1 Sam. 15:29</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Does God Sometimes Change His Mind?</span> Yet when we talk about God being unchanging in his purposes, we may wonder about places in Scripture where God said he would judge his people and then because of prayer or the people&rsquo;s repentance (or both) God relented and did not bring judgment as he had said he would. Examples of such withdrawing from threatened judgment include the successful intervention of Moses in prayer to prevent the destruction of the people of Israel (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex32.9-14">Ex. 32:9&ndash;14</a>), the adding of another fifteen years to the life of Hezekiah (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is38.1-6">Isa. 38:1&ndash;6</a>), or the failure to bring promised judgment upon Nineveh when the people repented (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jon3.4">Jonah 3:4</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jon3.10">10</a>). Are these not cases where God&rsquo;s purposes in fact did change? Then there are other passages where God is said to be sorry that he had carried out some previous action. One thinks of God being sorry that he had made man upon the earth (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge6.6">Gen. 6:6</a>), or sorry that he had made Saul king (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa15.10">1 Sam. 15:10</a>). Did not God&rsquo;s purposes change in these cases?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These instances should all be understood as true expressions of God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">present</span> attitude or intention <span style="font-style:italic;">with respect to the situation as it exists at that moment</span>. If the situation changes, then of course God&rsquo;s attitude or expression of intention will also change. This is just saying that <span style="font-style:italic;">God responds differently to different situations</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 165  </span>The example of Jonah preaching to Nineveh is helpful here. God sees the wickedness of Nineveh and sends Jonah to proclaim, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jon3.4">Jonah 3:4</a>). The possibility that God would withhold judgment if the people repented is not explicitly mentioned in Jonah&rsquo;s proclamation as recorded in Scripture, but it is of course <span style="font-style:italic;">implicit</span> in that warning: the <span style="font-style:italic;">purpose</span> for proclaiming a warning is to bring about repentance. Once the people repented, the situation was different, and God responded differently to that changed situation: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">When God saw what they did</span> how they turned from their evil way, <span style="font-style:italic;">God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them;</span> and he did not do it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jon3.10">Jonah 3:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The situations with Hezekiah and with the intercession of Moses are similar: God had said that he would send judgment, and that was a true declaration, <span style="font-style:italic;">provided that the situation remained the same</span>. But then the situation changed: someone started to pray earnestly (Moses in one case and Hezekiah in the other). Here prayer itself was part of the new situation and was in fact what changed the situation. God responded to that changed situation by answering the prayer and withholding judgment.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the cases of God being sorry that he had made man, or that he had made Saul king, these too can be understood as <span style="font-style:italic;">expressions of God&rsquo;s present displeasure</span> toward the sinfulness of man. In neither case is the language strong enough to require us to think that if God could start again and act differently, he would in fact not create man or not make Saul king. It can instead imply that God&rsquo;s previous action led to events that, in the short term, caused him sorrow, but that nonetheless in the long term would ultimately achieve his good purposes. This is somewhat analogous to a human father who allows his child to embark on a course he knows will bring much sorrow, both to the parent and to the child, but who allows it nonetheless, because he knows that greater long-term good will come from it.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. The Question of God&rsquo;s Impassibility</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Sometimes in a discussion of God&rsquo;s attributes theologians have spoken of another attribute, namely, the <span style="font-style:italic;">impassibility</span> of God. This attribute, if true, would mean that God does not have passions or emotions, but is &ldquo;impassible,&rdquo; not subject to passions. In fact, chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/WestminsterConfession.Chapter_II">2</a> of the Westminster Confession of Faith says that God is &ldquo;without … passions.&rdquo; This statement goes beyond what we have affirmed in our definition above about God&rsquo;s unchangeableness, and affirms <span style="font-style:italic;">more</span> than that God does not change in his being, perfections, purposes, or promises&mdash;it also affirms that God does not even feel emotions or &ldquo;passions.&rdquo;
	</p>

		The Scripture proof given by the Westminster Confession of Faith is <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.15">Acts 14:15</a>, which in the King James Version reports Barnabas and Paul as rejecting worship from the people at Lystra, protesting that they are not gods but &ldquo;men of <span style="font-style:italic;">like passions</span> with you.&rdquo; The implication of the KJV translation might be that someone who is truly God would not have &ldquo;like passions&rdquo; as men do, or it might simply show that the apostles were responding to the false view of passionless gods assumed by the men of Lystra (see vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.10-11">10&ndash;11</a>). But if the verse is rightly translated, it certainly does not prove that God has no passions or emotions at all, for the Greek term here (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ὁμοιοπαθής</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3926">G3926</a>) can simply mean having similar circumstances <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 166  </span>or experiences, or being of a similar nature to someone else. Of course, God does not have <span style="font-style:italic;">sinful</span> passions or emotions. But the idea that God has no passions or emotions <span style="font-style:italic;">at all</span> clearly conflicts with much of the rest of Scripture, and for that reason I have not affirmed God&rsquo;s impassibility in this book. Instead, quite the opposite is true, for God, who is the origin of our emotions and who created our emotions, certainly does feel emotions: God rejoices (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is62.5">Isa. 62:5</a>). He is grieved (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps78.40">Ps. 78:40</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.30">Eph. 4:30</a>). His wrath burns hot against his enemies (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex32.10">Ex. 32:10</a>). He pities his children (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.13">Ps. 103:13</a>). He loves with everlasting love (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is54.8">Isa. 54:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.17">Ps. 103:17</a>). He is a God whose passions we are to imitate for all eternity as we like our Creator hate sin and delight in righteousness.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">d. The Challenge From Process Theology</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> God&rsquo;s unchangeableness has been denied frequently in recent years by the advocates of <span style="font-style:italic;">process theology</span> a theological position that says that process and change are essential aspects of genuine existence, and that therefore God must be changing over time also, just like everything else that exists. In fact, Charles Hartshorne, the father of process theology, would say that God is continually adding to himself all the experiences that happen anywhere in the universe, and thus God is continually changing. The real appeal of process theology comes from the fact that all people have a deep longing to mean something, to feel significant in the universe. Process theologians dislike the doctrine of God&rsquo;s immutability because they think it implies that nothing we do can really matter to God. If God is really unchangeable, process theologians will say, then nothing we do&mdash;in fact, nothing that happens in the universe&mdash;has any real effect on God, because God can never change. So what difference do we make? How can we have any ultimate meaning? In response to this question process theologians reject the doctrine of God&rsquo;s immutability and tell us that our actions are so significant that they have an influence on the very being of God himself! As we act, and as the universe changes, God is <span style="font-style:italic;">truly</span> affected by these actions and the being of God changes&mdash;God <span style="font-style:italic;">becomes</span> something other than what he was.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Advocates of process theology often mistakenly accuse evangelical Christians (or the biblical writers themselves) of believing in a God who does not act in the world, or who cannot respond differently to different situations (errors we have discussed above). With regard to the idea that we must be able to influence the very being of God in order to be significant, we must respond that this is an <span style="font-style:italic;">incorrect assumption</span> imported into the discussion, and that it is not consistent with <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 167  </span>Scripture. Scripture is clear that our ultimate significance comes not from being able to change the being of God, but from the fact that God has created us for his glory and that <span style="font-style:italic;">he</span> counts us as significant. God alone gives the ultimate definition of what is significant and what is not significant in the universe, and if he counts us significant, then we are!
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The other fundamental error in process theology is in assuming that God must be changeable like the universe he created. This is what Scripture explicitly denies: &ldquo;You, Lord, did found the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands; they will perish, but you remain; they will all grow old like a garment … <span style="font-style:italic;">they will be changed. But you are the same</span> and your years will never end&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.10-12">Heb. 1:10&ndash;12</a>, quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps102.25-27">Ps. 102:25&ndash;27</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">e. God Is Both Infinite and Personal</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Our discussion of process theology illustrates a common difference between biblical Christianity and all other systems of theology. In the teaching of the Bible, God is both <span style="font-style:italic;">infinite</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">personal:</span> he is infinite in that he is not subject to any of the limitations of humanity, or of creation in general. He is far greater than everything he has made, far greater than anything else that exists. But he is also personal: he interacts with us as a person, and we can relate to him as persons. We can pray to him, worship him, obey him, and love him, and he can speak to us, rejoice in us, and love us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Apart from the true religion found in the Bible, no system of religion has a God who is both infinite and personal. For example, the gods of ancient Greek and Roman mythology were <span style="font-style:italic;">personal</span> (they interacted frequently with people), but they were not infinite: they had weaknesses and frequent moral failures, even petty rivalries. On the other hand, deism portrays a God who is <span style="font-style:italic;">infinite</span> but far too removed from the world to be personally involved in it. Similarly, pantheism holds that God is infinite (since the whole universe is thought to be God), but such a God can certainly not be personal or relate to us as persons.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The error of process theology fits this general pattern. Its advocates are convinced that a God who is unchanging in his being is so different from the rest of creation&mdash;so infinite, so unlimited by the change that characterizes all of our existence&mdash;that he <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> also be personal in a way that we make a difference to him. So in order to gain a God who is personal, they think they have to give up a God who is infinite for a God who is continually in process of change. This kind of reasoning is typical of many (perhaps all) objections to the kind of God presented in the Bible. People say that if God is infinite, he cannot be personal, or they say that if God is personal, he cannot be infinite. The Bible teaches that God is both infinite and personal. We must affirm both that God is infinite (or unlimited) with respect to change that occurs in the universe (nothing will change God&rsquo;s being, perfections, purposes, or promises), that God is <span style="font-style:italic;">also</span> personal, and that he relates to us personally and counts us valuable.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 168  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">f. The Importance of God&rsquo;s Unchangeableness</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> At first it may not seem very important to us to affirm God&rsquo;s unchangeableness. The idea is so abstract that we may not immediately realize its significance. But if we stop for a moment to imagine what it would be like if God <span style="font-style:italic;">could</span> change, the importance of this doctrine becomes more clear. For example, if God <span style="font-style:italic;">could</span> change (in his being, perfections, purposes, or promises), then any change would be either for the better or for the worse. But if God changed for the better, then he was not the best possible being when we first trusted him. And how could we be sure that he is the best possible being now? But if God could change for the worse (in his very <span style="font-style:italic;">being</span>), then what kind of God might he become? Might he become, for instance, a little bit evil rather than wholly good? And if he could become a little bit evil, then how do we know he could not change to become largely evil&mdash;or <span style="font-style:italic;">wholly</span> evil? And there would be not one thing we could do about it, for he is so much more powerful than we are. Thus, the idea that God could change leads to the horrible possibility that thousands of years from now we might come to live forever in a universe dominated by a wholly evil, omnipotent God. It is hard to imagine any thought more terrifying. How could we ever trust such a God who could change? How could we ever commit our lives to him?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, if God could change with regard to his <span style="font-style:italic;">purposes</span> then even though when the Bible was written he promised that Jesus would come back to rule over a new heaven and new earth, he has perhaps abandoned that plan now, and thus our hope in Jesus&rsquo; return is in vain. Or, if God could change in regard to his <span style="font-style:italic;">promises</span> then how could we trust him completely for eternal life? Or for anything else the Bible says? Maybe when the Bible was written he promised forgiveness of sins and eternal life to those who trust in Christ, but (if God can change) perhaps he has changed his mind on those promises now&mdash;how could we be sure? Or perhaps his omnipotence will change someday, so that even though he wants to keep his promises, he will no longer be able to do so.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A little reflection like this shows how absolutely important the doctrine of God&rsquo;s unchangeableness is. If God is not unchanging, then the whole basis of our faith begins to fall apart, and our understanding of the universe begins to unravel. This is because our faith and hope and knowledge all ultimately depend on a <span style="font-style:italic;">person</span> who is <span style="font-style:italic;">infinitely worthy of trust</span>&mdash;because he is <span style="font-style:italic;">absolutely</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">eternally</span> unchanging in his being, perfections, purposes, and promises.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Eternity</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> God&rsquo;s eternity may be defined as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">God has no beginning, end, or succession of moments in his own being, and he sees all time equally vividly, yet God sees events in time and acts in time</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Sometimes this doctrine is called the doctrine of God&rsquo;s infinity with respect to time. To be &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; is to be unlimited, and this doctrine teaches that time does not limit God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This doctrine is also related to God&rsquo;s unchangeableness. If it is true that God does not change, then we must say that <span style="font-style:italic;">time</span> does not change God: it has no effect on his being, perfections, purposes, or promises. But that means that time has no effect on God&rsquo;s knowledge, for instance. God never learns new things or forgets things, for that would mean a change in his perfect knowledge. This implies also <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 169  </span>that the passing of time does not add to or detract from God&rsquo;s knowledge: he knows all things past, present, and future, and knows them all equally vividly.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. God Is Timeless in His Own Being</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The fact that God has no beginning or end is seen in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps90.2">Psalm 90:2</a>: &ldquo;Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, <span style="font-style:italic;">from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</span>&rdquo; Similarly, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Job36.26">Job 36:26</a>, Elihu says of God, &ldquo;the number of his years is unsearchable.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God&rsquo;s eternity is also suggested by passages that talk about the fact that God always is or always exists. &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&rdquo; says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re1.8">Rev. 1:8</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.8">4:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is also indicated in Jesus&rsquo; bold use of a present tense verb that implies continuing present existence when he replied to his Jewish adversaries, &ldquo;Before Abraham was, <span style="font-style:italic;">I am</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn8.58">John 8:58</a>). This statement is itself an explicit claiming of the name of God, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I AM</span> WHO I AM,&rdquo; from <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex3.14">Exodus 3:14</a>, a name that also suggests a continual present existence: God is the eternal &ldquo;I AM,&rdquo; the one who eternally exists.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that God never began to exist can also be concluded from the fact that God created all things, and that he himself is an immaterial spirit. Before God made the universe, there was no matter, but then he created all things (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.1">Gen. 1:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.3">John 1:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.6">1 Cor. 8:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.16">Col. 1:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.2">Heb. 1:2</a>). The study of physics tells us that matter and time and space must all occur together: if there is no matter, there can be no space or time either. Thus, before God created the universe, there was no &ldquo;time,&rdquo; at least not in the sense of a succession of moments one after another. Therefore, when God created the universe, he also created time. When God began to create the universe, time began, and there began to be a succession of moments and events one after another. But before there was a universe, and before there was time, God always existed, without beginning, and without being influenced by time. And time, therefore, does not have existence in itself, but, like the rest of creation, depends on God&rsquo;s eternal being and power to keep it existing.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The foregoing Scripture passages and the fact that God always existed before there was any time combine to indicate to us that God&rsquo;s own being does not have a succession of moments or any progress from one state of existence to another. To God himself, all of his existence is always somehow &ldquo;present,&rdquo; though admittedly that idea is difficult for us to understand, for it is a kind of existence different from that which we experience.
	</p>

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 170  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">b. God Sees All Time Equally Vividly</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> It is somewhat easier for us to understand that God sees all time equally vividly. We read in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps90.4">Psalm 90:4</a>, &ldquo;For a <span style="font-style:italic;">thousand years</span> in your sight are but as <span style="font-style:italic;">yesterday</span> when it is past, or as a <span style="font-style:italic;">watch</span> in the night.&rdquo; It is sometimes difficult for us to remember events that occurred several weeks ago, or several months ago, or several years ago. We remember recent events more vividly, and the clarity of our memory fades with the passing of time. Even if it were possible for us to live &ldquo;a thousand years,&rdquo; we would remember very few events from hundreds of years earlier, and the clarity of that memory would be very low. But here Scripture tells us that God views a thousand years &ldquo;as yesterday.&rdquo; He can remember all the detailed events of a thousand years at least as clearly as we can remember the events of &ldquo;yesterday.&rdquo; In fact, to him a thousand years is &ldquo;as a watch in the night,&rdquo; a three-or four-hour period during which a guard would stand watch. Such a short period of time would pass quickly and all the events would be easily recalled. Yet this is how a thousand years seems to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we realize that the phrase &ldquo;a thousand years&rdquo; does not imply that God forgets things after 1,100 or 1,200 years, but rather expresses as long a time as one might imagine, it becomes evident that <span style="font-style:italic;">all of past history</span> is viewed by God with great clarity and vividness: all of time since the creation is to God as if it just happened. And it will always remain just that clear in his consciousness, throughout millions of years of eternity future.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the New Testament, Peter tells us, &ldquo;with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.8">2 Peter 3:8</a>). The second half of this statement had already been made in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps90">Psalm 90</a>, but the first half introduces an additional consideration, &ldquo;One day is as a thousand years&rdquo;; that is, any one day from God&rsquo;s perspective seems to last for &ldquo;a thousand years&rdquo;: it is as if that day never ends, but is always being experienced. Again, since &ldquo;a thousand years&rdquo; is a figurative expression for &ldquo;as long a time as we can imagine,&rdquo; or &ldquo;all history,&rdquo; we can say from this verse that any one day seems to God to be present to his consciousness forever.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Taking these two considerations together, we can say the following: in God&rsquo;s perspective, any extremely long period of time is as if it just happened. And any very short period of time (such as one day) seems to God to last forever: it never ceases to be &ldquo;present&rdquo; in his consciousness. Thus, God sees and knows all events past, present, and future with equal vividness. This should never cause us to think that God does not see events <span style="font-style:italic;">in time</span> and act <span style="font-style:italic;">in time</span> (see below), but just the opposite: God is the eternal Lord and Sovereign over history, and he sees it more clearly and acts in it more decisively than any other. But, once we have said that, we still must affirm that these verses speak of God&rsquo;s relationship to time in a way that we do not and cannot experience: God&rsquo;s experience of time is not just a patient endurance through eons of endless duration, but he has a <span style="font-style:italic;">qualitatively different</span> experience of time than we do. This is consistent with the idea that in his own being, God is timeless; he does not experience a succession of moments. This has been the dominant view of Christian orthodoxy throughout the history of the church, though it has been frequently challenged, and even today many theologians deny it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 171  </span>We can picture God&rsquo;s relationship to time as in figure <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.11.1.2.3.2.1">11.1</a>. This diagram is meant to show that God created time and is Lord over time. Therefore he can see all events in time equally vividly, yet he also can see events in time and act in time.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The diagram also anticipates the following discussion, since it indicates that God knows events in the future, even the infinitely long eternal future. With regard to the future, God frequently claims through the Old Testament prophets that <span style="font-style:italic;">he alone is the one who knows and can declare future events</span>. &ldquo;Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old? Was it not I, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>? And there is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is45.21">Isa. 45:21</a>). Similarly, we read:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		For I am God, and there is no other;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		I am God, and <span style="font-style:italic;">there is none like me,</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">declaring the end from the beginning</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">and from ancient times things not yet done,</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		saying, &ldquo;My counsel shall stand,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		and I will accomplish all my purpose.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-right:36pt; text-align:right;" lang="en-US">
		(<a href="https://ref.ly/Is46.9-10">Isa. 46:9&ndash;10</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Thus God somehow stands above time and is able to see it all as present in his consciousness. Although the analogy is not perfect, we might think of the moment we finish reading a long novel. Before putting it back on the shelf we might flip quickly through the pages once more, calling to mind the many events that had occurred in that novel. For a brief moment, things that transpired over a long period of time all seem to be &ldquo;present&rdquo; to our minds. Perhaps this is faintly analogous to God&rsquo;s experience of seeing all of history as equally present in his consciousness.

God observed clearly and knew exactly what was happening with events in his creation as they occurred over time. We might say that God watched the progress of time as various events occurred within his creation. Then at the right time, &ldquo;when the time had fully come,&rdquo; God sent forth his Son into the world.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is evident throughout Scripture that God acts within time and acts differently at different points in time. For example, Paul tells the men of Athens, &ldquo;The times of ignorance God overlooked, but <span style="font-style:italic;">now</span> he commands all men everywhere to repent, because <span style="font-style:italic;">he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world</span> in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.30-31">Acts 17:30&ndash;31</a>). This statement includes a description of a previous way in which God acted, God&rsquo;s present way of acting, and a future activity that he will carry out, all in time.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Indeed, the repeated emphasis on God&rsquo;s ability to predict the future in the Old Testament prophets requires us to realize that God predicts his actions at one point in time and then carries out his actions at a later point in time. And on a larger scale, the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is God&rsquo;s own record of the way he has acted over time to bring redemption to his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We must therefore affirm both that God has no succession of moments in his own being and sees all history equally vividly, and that in his creation he sees the progress of events over time and acts differently at different points in time; in short, he is the Lord who created time and who rules over it and uses it for his own purposes. God can act in time <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> he is Lord of time. He uses it to <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 173  </span>display his glory. In fact, it is often God&rsquo;s good pleasure to fulfill his promises and carry out his works of redemption over a period of time so that we might more readily see and appreciate his great wisdom, his patience, his faithfulness, his lordship over all events, and even his unchangeableness and eternity.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">d. We Will Always Exist in Time</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Will we ever share in God&rsquo;s eternity? Specifically, in the new heaven and new earth which are yet to come, will time still exist? Some have thought that it would not. In fact, there is a hymn that begins, &ldquo;When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more …&rdquo; And we read in Scripture, &ldquo;And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb … and there shall be no night there&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.23">Rev. 21:23</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.25">25</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.5">22:5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, it is not true to say that heaven will be &ldquo;timeless,&rdquo; or without the presence of time or the passage of time. Rather, as long as we are finite creatures we will necessarily experience events one after another. Even the passage that talks about no night being in heaven also mentions the fact that the kings of the earth will bring into the heavenly city &ldquo;the glory and the honor of the nations&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.26">Rev. 21:26</a>). We are told concerning the light of the heavenly city, &ldquo;By its light shall the nations walk&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.24">Rev. 21:24</a>). These activities of bringing things into the heavenly city and walking by the light of the heavenly city imply that events are done one after another. Something is outside the heavenly city, and then at a later point in time this thing is part of the glory and honor of the nations that are brought into the heavenly city. To cast one&rsquo;s crown before the throne of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.10">Rev. 4:10</a>) requires that at one moment the person has a crown and that at a later moment that crown is cast before the throne. To sing a new song of praise before God in heaven requires that one word be sung after another. In fact, the &ldquo;tree of life&rdquo; in the heavenly city is said to be &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">yielding its fruit each month</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.2">Rev. 22:2</a>), which implies a regular passage of time and the occurrence of events in time.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore, there will still be a succession of moments one after another and things happening one after another in heaven. We will experience eternal life not in an exact duplication of God&rsquo;s attribute of eternity, but rather in a duration of time that will never end: we, as God&rsquo;s people will experience fullness of joy in God&rsquo;s presence for all eternity&mdash;not in the sense that we will no longer experience time, but in the sense that our lives with him will go on forever: &ldquo;And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, <span style="font-style:italic;">and they shall reign for ever and ever</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.5">Rev. 22:5</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Omnipresence</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Just as God is unlimited or infinite with respect to time, so God is unlimited with respect to space. This characteristic of God&rsquo;s nature is called God&rsquo;s omnipresence (the Latin prefix <span style="font-style:italic;" lang="la">omni</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span> means &ldquo;all&rdquo;). God&rsquo;s omnipresence may be defined as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">God does not have size or spatial dimensions and is present at every point of space with his whole being, yet God acts differently in different places</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that God is Lord of space and cannot be limited by space is evident first <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 174  </span>from the fact that he created it, for the creation of the material world (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.1">Gen. 1:1</a>) implies the creation of space as well. Moses reminded the people of God&rsquo;s lordship over space: &ldquo;Behold, to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt10.14">Deut. 10:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. God Is Present Everywhere</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Yet there are also specific passages that speak of God&rsquo;s presence in every part of space. We read in Jeremiah, &ldquo;Am I a God at hand, says the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, and not a God afar off? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? says the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Do I not fill heaven and earth?</span> says the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je23.23-24">Jer. 23:23&ndash;24</a>). God is here rebuking the prophets who think their words or thoughts are hidden from God. He is everywhere and fills heaven and earth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God&rsquo;s omnipresence is beautifully expressed by David:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Whither shall I go from your Spirit?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There is nowhere in the entire universe, on land or sea, in heaven or in hell, where one can flee from God&rsquo;s presence.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should note also that there is no indication that simply a <span style="font-style:italic;">part</span> of God is in one place and a part of him in another. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">God himself</span> who is present wherever David might go. We cannot say that some of God or just part of God is present, for that would be to think of his being in spatial terms, as if he were limited somehow by space. It seems more appropriate to say that God is present <span style="font-style:italic;">with his whole being</span> in every part of space (cf. also <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.28">Acts 17:28</a> where Paul affirms the correctness of the words, &ldquo;In him we live and move and have our being,&rdquo; and <a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.17">Col. 1:17</a>, which says of Christ, &ldquo;in him all things hold together&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. God Does Not Have Spatial Dimensions</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> While it seems necessary for us to say that God&rsquo;s whole being is present in every part of space, or at every point in space, it is also necessary to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">God cannot be contained by any space</span> no matter how large. Solomon says in his prayer to God, &ldquo;But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, <span style="font-style:italic;">heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you;</span> how much less this house which I have built!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki8.27">1 Kings 8:27</a>). Heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain God; indeed, he cannot be contained by the largest space imaginable (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Is66.1-2">Isa. 66:1&ndash;2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.48">Acts 7:48</a>). While the thought that God is everywhere present with his whole being ought to encourage us greatly in prayer no matter where we are, the fact that no one place can be said to contain God should also discourage us from thinking that there is some special place of worship that gives people special access to God: he cannot be contained in any one place.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should guard against thinking that God extends infinitely far in all directions so that he himself exists in a sort of infinite, unending space. Nor should we think that God is somehow a &ldquo;bigger space&rdquo; or bigger area surrounding the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 175  </span>space of the universe as we know it. All of these ideas continue to think of God&rsquo;s being in spatial terms, as if he were simply an extremely large being. Instead, we should try to avoid thinking of God in terms of size or spatial dimensions. God is a being who exists <span style="font-style:italic;">without</span> size or dimensions in space. In fact, before God created the universe, there was no matter or material so there was no space either. Yet God still existed. Where was God? He was not in a place that we could call a &ldquo;where,&rdquo; for there was no &ldquo;where&rdquo; or space. But God still was! This fact makes us realize that God relates to space in a far different way than we do or than any created thing does. He exists as a kind of being that is far different and far greater than we can imagine.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We must also be careful not to think that God himself is equivalent to any part of creation or to all of it. A pantheist believes that everything is God, or that God is everything that exists. The biblical perspective is rather that God is <span style="font-style:italic;">present</span> everywhere in his creation, but that he is also distinct from his creation. How can this be? The analogy of a sponge filled with water is not perfect, but it is helpful. Water is present everywhere in the sponge, but the water is still completely distinct from the sponge. Now this analogy breaks down at very small points within the sponge, where we could say that there is sponge at one point and not water, or water and not sponge. Yet this is because the analogy is dealing with two materials that have spatial characteristics and dimensions, while God does not.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. God Can Be Present to Punish, to Sustain, or to Bless</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The idea of God&rsquo;s omnipresence has sometimes troubled people who wonder how God can be present, for example, in hell. In fact, isn&rsquo;t hell the opposite of God&rsquo;s presence, or the absence of God? This difficulty can be resolved by realizing that <span style="font-style:italic;">God is present in different ways in different places</span> or that God acts differently in different places in his creation. Sometimes God is <span style="font-style:italic;">present to punish</span>. A terrifying passage in Amos vividly portrays this presence of God in judgment:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">

		At other times God is present neither to punish nor to bless, but merely <span style="font-style:italic;">present to sustain</span> or to keep the universe existing and functioning in the way he intended it to function. In this sense the divine nature of Christ is everywhere present: &ldquo;He is before all things, and in him all things hold together&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.17">Col. 1:17</a>). The author of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 176  </span>Hebrews says of God the Son that he is (continually) &ldquo;upholding the universe by his word of power&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.3">Heb. 1:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet at other times or in other places God is <span style="font-style:italic;">present to bless</span>. David says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">in your presence</span> there is fulness of joy, in your right hand are pleasures for evermore&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps16.11">Ps. 16:11</a>). Here David is speaking not of God&rsquo;s presence to punish or merely to sustain, but of God&rsquo;s presence to bless.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, most of the time that the Bible talks about God&rsquo;s presence, it is referring to God&rsquo;s presence to bless. For example, it is in this way that we should understand God&rsquo;s presence above the ark of the covenant in the Old Testament. We read of &ldquo;the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> of hosts, who is <span style="font-style:italic;">enthroned on the cherubim</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa4.4">1 Sam. 4:4</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex25.22">Ex. 25:22</a>), a reference to the fact that God made his presence known and acted in a special way to bring blessing and protection to his people at the location he had designated as his throne, namely, the place above the two golden figures of heavenly beings (&ldquo;cherubim&rdquo;) that were over the top of the ark of the covenant. It is not that God was not present elsewhere, but rather that here he especially made his presence known and here he especially manifested his character and brought blessing to his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the new covenant, there is no one place on earth that God has chosen as his particular dwelling place, for we can worship him anywhere (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.20">John 4:20</a>). But now and for all eternity God has chosen the place the Bible calls &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; to be the focus of the manifestation of his character and the presence of his blessing and glory. So when the new Jerusalem comes down out of heaven from God, John in his vision hears a loud voice from God&rsquo;s throne saying, &ldquo;Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.3">Rev. 21:3</a>). We might find it misleading to say that God is &ldquo;more present&rdquo; in heaven than anywhere else, but it would not be misleading to say that God is present in a special way in heaven, present especially there to bless and to show forth his glory. We could also say that God manifests his presence more fully in heaven than elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this way also Paul&rsquo;s statement about Christ can be understood: &ldquo;In him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.9">Col. 2:9</a>). In one sense of course we could say that God&rsquo;s whole being is present at every point in space and therefore at every point in every person, not only in Christ. But there are two difficulties with speaking this way: (1) The Bible never speaks about God&rsquo;s presence in unbelievers in a direct way, probably to avoid any connection between God and the responsibility or blame for evil deeds, and probably also to avoid any suggestion of God&rsquo;s presence to bless, since it is only a presence to sustain. (2) Furthermore, this sense of &ldquo;present to sustain&rdquo; is not the sense Paul has in mind in <a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.9">Colossians 2:9</a>. In fact, there Paul does not even seem to mean simply &ldquo;present to bless&rdquo; in the same sense in which God is present to bless in the lives of all believers. Rather, Paul seems to mean that in Christ God&rsquo;s own nature is present to bless and to manifest his character in the fullest and most complete way possible.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Our difficulty in understanding how to express the way in which God is present <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 177  </span>in unbelievers, for example, leads us to realize that although the Bible <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> speak of God as being present everywhere, when the Bible says that God is &ldquo;present&rdquo; it <span style="font-style:italic;">usually</span> means &ldquo;present to bless.&rdquo; That is, although there are a few references to God&rsquo;s presence to sustain or presence to punish, the vast majority of biblical references to God&rsquo;s presence are simply more brief ways of stating that he is <span style="font-style:italic;">present to bless</span>. When we become more and more familiar with this biblical pattern of speech, it becomes more and more difficult to speak of God&rsquo;s presence in any other way. And perhaps it is even misleading to do so unless a clear explanation of our meaning can be given.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some examples of the usual biblical means of expression are as follows: <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co3.17">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>: &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&rdquo;; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.9-10">Romans 8:9&ndash;10</a>: &ldquo;you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you … if Christ is in you … your spirits are alive&rdquo;; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.23">John 14:23</a>: &ldquo;If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him,&rdquo; and so forth. All of these verses talk about God&rsquo;s presence and assume that we understand that they mean God&rsquo;s presence <span style="font-style:italic;">to bless</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In a parallel kind of expression, when the Bible talks about God being &ldquo;far away&rdquo; it usually means he is &ldquo;not present to bless.&rdquo; For example, <a href="https://ref.ly/Is59.2">Isaiah 59:2</a> says, &ldquo;Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God,&rdquo; and <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr15.29">Proverbs 15:29</a> declares: &ldquo;The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In summary, God is present in every part of space with his whole being, yet God acts differently in different places. Furthermore, when the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s presence, it usually means his presence to bless, and it is only normal for our own speech to conform to this biblical usage.

		Herman Bavinck, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Doctrine of God</span> quotes a beautiful paragraph illustrating the practical application of the doctrine of God&rsquo;s omnipresence:

	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When you wish to do something evil, you retire from the public into your house where no enemy may see you; from those places of your house which are open and visible to the eyes of men you remove yourself into your room; even in your room you fear some witness from another quarter; you retire into your heart, there you meditate: he is more inward than your heart. Wherever, therefore, you shall have fled, there he is. From yourself, whither will you flee? Will you not follow yourself wherever you shall flee? But since there is One more inward even than yourself, there is no place where you may flee from God angry but to God reconciled. There is no place at all whither you may flee. Will you flee from him? Flee unto him.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 178  </span>When Scripture speaks about God&rsquo;s attributes it never singles out one attribute of God as more important than all the rest. There is an assumption that every attribute is completely true of God and is true of all of God&rsquo;s character. For example, John can say that &ldquo;God is light&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn1.5">1 John 1:5</a>) and then a little later say also that &ldquo;God is love&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.8">1 John 4:8</a>). There is no suggestion that part of God is light and part of God is love, or that God is partly light and partly love. Nor should we think that God is more light than love or more love than light. Rather it is <span style="font-style:italic;">God himself</span> who is light, and it is <span style="font-style:italic;">God himself</span> who is also love.

		The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> passed before him and proclaimed, &ldquo;The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children&rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.&rdquo;

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">

		We could of course go on with different sorts of lines for each of the different attributes of God. But it should be clear that each attribute is simply a way of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 180  </span>describing one aspect of God&rsquo;s total character or being. God himself is a <span style="font-style:italic;">unity</span> a unified and completely integrated whole person who is infinitely perfect in <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> of these attributes.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Why then does Scripture speak of these different attributes of God? It is probably because we are unable to grasp all of God&rsquo;s character at one time, and we need to learn of it from different perspectives over a period of time. Yet these perspectives should never be set in opposition to one another, for they are just different ways of looking at the totality of God&rsquo;s character.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In terms of practical application, this means that we should never think, for example, that God is a loving God at one point in history and a just or wrathful God at another point in history. He is the same God always, and everything he says or does is fully consistent with all his attributes. It is not accurate to say, as some have said, that God is a God of justice in the Old Testament and a God of love in the New Testament. God is and always has been infinitely just and infinitely loving as well, and everything he does in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament is completely consistent with both of those attributes.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now it is true that some actions of God show certain of his attributes more prominently. Creation demonstrates his power and wisdom, the atonement demonstrates his love and justice, and the radiance of heaven demonstrates his glory and beauty. But all of these in some way or other <span style="font-style:italic;">also</span> demonstrate his knowledge and holiness and mercy and truthfulness and patience and sovereignty, and so forth. It would be difficult indeed to find some attribute of God that is not reflected at least to some degree in any one of his acts of redemption. This is due to the fact mentioned above: God is a unity and everything he does is an act of the whole person of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, the doctrine of the unity of God should caution us against attempting to single out any one attribute of God as more important than all the others. At various times people have attempted to see God&rsquo;s holiness, or his love, or his self-existence, or his righteousness, or some other attribute as the most important attribute of his being. But all such attempts seem to misconceive of God as a combination of various parts, with some parts being somehow larger or more influential than others. Furthermore, it is hard to understand exactly what &ldquo;most important&rdquo; might mean. Does it mean that there are some actions of God that are not fully consistent with some of his other attributes? That there are some attributes that God somehow sets aside at times in order to act in ways slightly contrary to those attributes? Certainly we cannot maintain either of these views, for that would mean that God is inconsistent with his own character or that he changes and becomes something different from what he was previously. Rather, when we see all the attributes as merely various aspects of the total character of God, then such a question becomes quite unnecessary and we discover that there is no attribute that can be singled out as more important. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">God himself in his whole being</span> who is supremely important, and it is God himself in his whole being whom we are to seek to know and to love.

		 1. As you think of God&rsquo;s independence, unchangeableness, eternity, omnipresence, and unity, can you see some faint reflections of these five incommunicable attributes in yourself as God created you to be? What would it mean to strive to become more like God in these areas? At what point would it be wrong to even want to be like God in each of these areas because it would be attempting to usurp his unique role as Creator and Lord?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. Using each of these five incommunicable attributes, explain how we will be more like God in heaven than we are now, and also how we will for all eternity be unlike God in each of these five areas.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Explain how each aspect of the doctrine of God&rsquo;s independence makes you feel emotionally. Does this doctrine have a positive or negative effect on your spiritual life? Explain why.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. Explain how the doctrine of God&rsquo;s immutability or unchangeableness helps to answer the following questions: Will we be able to do a good job of bringing up children in such an evil world as we have today? Is it possible to have the same close fellowship with God that people had during biblical times? What can we think or do to make Bible stories seem more real and less removed from our present life? Do you think that God is less willing to answer prayer today than he was in Bible times?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. If you sin against God today, when would it start bringing sorrow to God&rsquo;s heart? When would it stop bringing sorrow to God&rsquo;s heart? Does this reflection help you understand why God&rsquo;s character requires that he punish sin? Why did God have to send his Son to bear the punishment for sin instead of simply forgetting about sin and welcoming sinners into heaven without having given the punishment for sin to anyone? Does God now think of your sins as forgiven or as unforgiven sins?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 6. If you sing praise to God today, when will the sound of that praise cease being present in God&rsquo;s consciousness and bringing delight to his heart? Do songs of praise to God have any ultimate meaning? What about trusting in him hour by hour or obeying him throughout each day?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">

		In several lines of this hymn the various attributes of God are mentioned in such rapid succession that it is impossible for us to reflect on each one individually as we sing. That is not entirely a disadvantage of the hymn, however, for it makes us realize that when we finally see God in all his glory in heaven, the wonder of beholding him and all his perfections at once will overwhelm us far more completely than does this hymn, and we will find ourselves lost in praise.

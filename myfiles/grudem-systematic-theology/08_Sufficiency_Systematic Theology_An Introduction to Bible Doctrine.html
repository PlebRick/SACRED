		A. Definition of the Sufficiency of Scripture
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		We can define the sufficiency of Scripture as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">The sufficiency of Scripture means that Scripture contained all the words of God he intended his people to have at each stage of redemptive history, and that it now contains everything we need God to tell us for salvation, for trusting him perfectly, and for obeying him perfectly</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This definition emphasizes that it is in Scripture alone that we are to search for God&rsquo;s words to us. It also reminds us that God considers what he has told us in the Bible to be enough for us, and that we should rejoice in the great revelation that he has given us and be content with it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Significant scriptural support and explanation of this doctrine is found in Paul&rsquo;s words to Timothy, &ldquo;from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are <span style="font-style:italic;">able to instruct you for salvation</span> through faith in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Ti3.15">2 Tim. 3:15</a>). The context shows that &ldquo;sacred writings&rdquo; here means the written words of Scripture (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Ti3.16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>). This is an indication that the words of God which we have in Scripture are all the words of God we need in order to be saved: these words are able to make us wise &ldquo;for salvation.&rdquo; This is confirmed by other passages that talk about the words of Scripture as the means God uses to bring us to salvation (<a href="logosref:Bible.Jas1.18">James 1:18</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Pe1.23">1 Peter 1:23</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Other passages indicate that the Bible is sufficient to equip us for living the Christian life. Once again Paul writes to Timothy, &ldquo;All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, <span style="font-style:italic;">that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work</span>&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Ti3.16-17">2 Tim. 3:16&ndash;17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Here Paul indicates that one purpose for which God caused Scripture to be written is to train us that we might be &ldquo;equipped for every good work.&rdquo; If there is any &ldquo;good work&rdquo; that God wants a Christian to do, this passage indicates that God has made provision in his Word for training the Christian in it. Thus, there is <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 128  </span>no &ldquo;good work&rdquo; that God wants us to do other than those that are taught somewhere in Scripture: it can equip us for <span style="font-style:italic;">every</span> good work.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		A similar teaching is found in <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119">Psalm 119</a>: &ldquo;Blessed are those whose way is <span style="font-style:italic;">blameless</span> who <span style="font-style:italic;">walk in the law of the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;">!</span>&rdquo; (v. <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119.1">1</a>). This verse shows an equivalence between being &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; and &ldquo;walking in the law of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo;: those who are blameless are those who walk in the law of the Lord. Here again is an indication that all that God requires of us is recorded in his written Word: simply to do all that the Bible commands us is to be blameless in God&rsquo;s sight.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		To be morally perfect in God&rsquo;s sight, then, what must we do in addition to what God commands us in Scripture? Nothing! Nothing at all! If we simply keep the words of Scripture we will be &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; and we will be doing &ldquo;every good work&rdquo; that God expects of us.

		B. We Can Find All That God Has Said on Particular Topics, and We Can Find Answers to Our Questions
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Of course, we realize that we will never perfectly obey all of Scripture in this life (see <a href="logosref:Bible.Jas3.2">James 3:2</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Jn1.8-10">1 John 1:8&ndash;10</a>; and chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.3.24.0.0.0.0.0">24</a>, below). Thus, it may not at first seem very significant to say that all we have to do is what God commands us in the Bible, since we will never be able to obey it all in this life anyway. But the truth of the sufficiency of Scripture is of great significance for our Christian lives, for it enables us to <span style="font-style:italic;">focus</span> our search for God&rsquo;s words to us on the Bible alone and saves us from the endless task of searching through all the writings of Christians throughout history, or through all the teachings of the church, or through all the subjective feelings and impressions that come to our minds from day to day,<sup>1</sup>
		
			
		 in order to find what God requires of us. In a very practical sense, it means that we are able to come to clear conclusions on many teachings of Scripture. For example, though it requires some work, it is possible to find all the biblical passages that are directly relevant to the matters of marriage and divorce, or the responsibilities of parents to children, or the relationship between a Christian and civil government.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This doctrine means, moreover, that it is possible to collect all the passages that directly relate to doctrinal issues such as the atonement, or the person of Christ, or <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 129  </span>the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer&rsquo;s life today. In these and hundreds of other moral and doctrinal questions, the biblical teaching about the sufficiency of Scripture gives us confidence that we <span style="font-style:italic;">will be able to find</span> what God requires us to think or to do in these areas. In many of these areas we can attain confidence that we, together with the vast majority of the church throughout history, have found and correctly formulated what God wants us to think or to do. Simply stated, the doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture tells us that it is possible to study systematic theology and ethics and find answers to our questions.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		At this point we differ from Roman Catholic theologians, who would say that we have not found all that God says to us about any particular subject until we have also listened to the official teaching of the church throughout its history. We would respond that although the history of the church may help us to <span style="font-style:italic;">understand</span> what God says to us in the Bible, never in church history has God <span style="font-style:italic;">added</span> to the teachings or commands of Scripture: Nowhere in church history outside of Scripture has God <span style="font-style:italic;">added</span> anything that he requires us to believe or to do. Scripture is sufficient to equip us for &ldquo;every good work,&rdquo; and to walk in its ways is to be &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; in God&rsquo;s sight.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		At this point we also differ from nonevangelical theologians who are not convinced that the Bible is God&rsquo;s Word in any unique or absolutely authoritative sense, and who would therefore search not only the Bible but also many other early Christian writings in an attempt to find not so much <span style="font-style:italic;">what God said</span> to mankind but rather <span style="font-style:italic;">what many early Christians experienced</span> in their relationship with God. They would not expect to arrive at a single, unified conclusion about what God wants us to think or do with regard to any particular question, but to discover a variety of opinions and viewpoints collected around some major unifying ideas. All of the viewpoints held by early Christians in any of the early churches would then be potentially valid viewpoints for Christians to hold today as well. To this we would reply that our search for answers to theological and ethical questions is not a search to find what various believers have thought in the history of the church, but is a quest to find and understand what God himself says to us in his own words, which are found in Scripture and only in Scripture.

		C. The Amount of Scripture Given Was Sufficient at Each Stage of Redemptive History
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture does not imply that <span style="font-style:italic;">God</span> cannot add any more words to those he has already spoken to his people. It rather implies that <span style="font-style:italic;">man</span> cannot add on his own initiative any words to those that God has already spoken. Furthermore, it implies that in fact <span style="font-style:italic;">God has not spoken</span> to mankind any more words which he requires us to believe or obey other than those which we have now in the Bible.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This point is important, for it helps us to understand how God could tell his people that his words to them were sufficient at many different points in the history of redemption, and how he could nevertheless add to those words later. For example, in <a href="logosref:Bible.Dt29.29">Deuteronomy 29:29</a> Moses says, &ldquo;The secret things belong to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This verse reminds us that God has always taken the initiative in revealing <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 130  </span>things to us. He has decided what to reveal and what not to reveal. At each stage in redemptive history, the things that God had revealed were for his people for that time, and they were to study, believe, and obey those things. With further progress in the history of redemption, more of God&rsquo;s words were added, recording and interpreting that history (see chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.1.3.0.0.0.0.0">3</a> above regarding the development of the canon).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, at the time of the death of Moses, the first five books of our Old Testament were sufficient for God&rsquo;s people at that time. But God directed later authors to add more so that Scripture would be sufficient for believers in subsequent times. For Christians today, the words from God that we have in the Old and New Testaments together are sufficient for us during the church age. After the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, and the founding of the early church as recorded in the New Testament, and the assembling of the books of the New Testament canon, no further central redemptive acts of God in history (acts that have direct relevance for all God&rsquo;s people for all subsequent time) have occurred, and thus no further words of God have been given to record and interpret those acts for us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This means that we can cite Scripture texts from throughout the canon to show that the principle of the sufficiency of God&rsquo;s revelation to his people at each particular time has remained the same. In this sense, these verses that talk about the sufficiency of Scripture in earlier periods are directly applicable to us as well, even though the extent of the Bible to which they refer in our situation is greater than the extent of the Scripture to which they referred in their original setting. The following texts from Scripture thus apply to us also in that sense:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">You shall not add to the word which I command you</span> nor take from it; that you may keep the commandments of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> your God which I command you. (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt4.2">Deut. 4:2</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">
		Everything that I command you you shall be careful to do; <span style="font-style:italic;">you shall not add to it or take from it</span>. (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt12.32">Deut. 12:32</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">
		Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. <span style="font-style:italic;">Do not add to his words</span> lest he rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (<a href="logosref:Bible.Pr30.5-6">Prov. 30:5&ndash;6</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">

		D. Practical Applications of the Sufficiency of Scripture
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture has several practical applications to our Christian lives. The following list is intended to be helpful but not exhaustive.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		1. The sufficiency of Scripture should encourage us as we try to discover what God would have us to <span style="font-style:italic;">think</span> (about a particular doctrinal issue) or to <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> (in a particular situation). We should be encouraged that <span style="font-style:italic;">everything</span> God wants to tell <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 131  </span>us about that question is to be found in Scripture. This does not mean that the Bible answers all the questions that we might think up, for &ldquo;The secret things belong to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> our God&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt29.29">Deut. 29:29</a>). But it does mean that when we are facing a problem of genuine importance to our Christian life, we can approach Scripture with the confidence that from it God will provide us with guidance for that problem.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		There will of course be some times when the answer we find is that Scripture does not speak directly to our question. (This would be the case, for example, if we tried to find from Scripture what &ldquo;order of worship&rdquo; to follow on Sunday mornings, or whether it is better to kneel or perhaps to stand when we pray, or at what time we should eat our meals during the day, etc.) In those cases, we may conclude that God has not required us to think or to act in any certain way with regard to that question (except, perhaps, in terms of more general principles regarding our attitudes and goals). But in many other cases we will find direct and clear guidance from the Lord to equip us for &ldquo;every good work&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Ti3.17">2 Tim. 3:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		As we go through life, frequent practice in searching Scripture for guidance will result in an increasing ability to find accurate, carefully formulated answers to our problems and questions. Lifelong growth in understanding Scripture will thus include growth in the skill of rightly understanding the Bible&rsquo;s teachings and applying them to specific questions.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		2. The sufficiency of Scripture reminds us that <span style="font-style:italic;">we are to add nothing to Scripture</span> and that <span style="font-style:italic;">we are to consider no other writings of equal value to Scripture</span>. This principle is violated by almost all cults and sects. Mormons, for example, claim to believe the Bible, but they also claim divine authority for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Book of Mormon</span>. Christian Scientists similarly claim to believe the Bible, but in practice they hold the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health With a Key to the Scriptures</span> by Mary Baker Eddy, on a par with Scripture or above it in authority. Since these claims violate God&rsquo;s commands not to add to his words, we should not think that any additional words from God to us would be found in these writings. Even in Christian churches a similar error is sometimes made when people go beyond what Scripture says and assert with great confidence new ideas about God or heaven, basing their teachings not on Scripture but on their own speculation or even on claimed experiences of dying and coming back to life.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		3. The sufficiency of Scripture also tells us that <span style="font-style:italic;">God does not require us to believe anything about himself or his redemptive work that is not found in Scripture</span>. Among writings from the time of the early church are some collections of alleged sayings of Jesus that were not preserved in the Gospels. It is likely that at least some of the &ldquo;sayings of Jesus&rdquo; found in these writings are rather accurate records of things Jesus actually said (though it is now impossible for us to determine with any high degree of probability which sayings those are). But it does not really matter at all for our Christian lives if we never read any of those sayings, for God has caused to be recorded in Scripture everything that we need to know about Jesus&rsquo; words and deeds in order to trust and obey him perfectly. Though these collections of sayings do have some limited value in linguistic research and perhaps in the study of the history of the church, they are of no direct value whatever for us in learning what we should believe about the life and teachings of Christ, or in formulating our doctrinal or ethical convictions.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		4. The sufficiency of Scripture shows us that <span style="font-style:italic;">no modern revelations from God are </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 132  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">to be placed on a level equal to Scripture in authority</span>. At various times throughout the history of the church, and particularly in the modern charismatic movement, people have claimed that God has given revelations through them for the benefit of the church. However we may evaluate such claims,<sup>3</sup>
		
			
		 we must be careful never to allow (in theory or in practice) the placing of such revelations on a level equal to Scripture.<sup>4</sup>
		
			
		 We must insist that God does not require us to believe anything about himself or his work in the world that is contained in these revelations but not in Scripture. And we must insist that God does not require us to obey any moral directives that come to us through such means but that are not confirmed by Scripture. The Bible contains everything we need God to tell us for trusting and obeying him perfectly.<sup>5</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		It should also be noted at this point that whenever challenges to the sufficiency of Scripture have come in the form of other documents to be placed alongside Scripture (whether from extrabiblical Christian literature of the first century or from the accumulated teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, or from the books of various cults such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Book of Mormon</span>), the result has always been (1) to deemphasize the teachings of the Bible itself and (2) to begin to teach some things that are contrary to Scripture. This is a danger of which the church must constantly be aware.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		5. With regard to living the Christian life, the sufficiency of Scripture reminds us that <span style="font-style:italic;">nothing is sin that is not forbidden by Scripture either explicitly or by implication</span>. To walk in the law of the Lord is to be &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119.1">Ps. 119:1</a>). Therefore we are not to add prohibitions to those already stated in Scripture. From time to time there may be situations in which it would be wrong, for example, for an individual Christian to drink coffee or Coca-Cola, or to attend movie theaters, or to eat meat offered to idols (see <a href="logosref:Bible.1Co8-10">1 Cor. 8&ndash;10</a>), but unless some specific teaching or some general principle of Scripture can be shown to prohibit these (or any other activities) for all believers for all time, we must insist that these activities are not in themselves sinful and they are not in all situations prohibited by God for his people.<sup>6</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 133  </span>This also is an important principle because there is always the tendency among believers to begin to neglect the regular daily searching of Scripture for guidance and to begin to live by a set of written or unwritten rules (or denominational traditions) concerning what one does or does not do in the Christian life.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Furthermore, whenever we add to the list of sins that are prohibited by Scripture itself, there will be harm to the church and to the lives of individual believers. The Holy Spirit will not empower obedience to rules that do not have God&rsquo;s approval from Scripture, nor will believers generally find delight in obedience to commands that do not accord with the laws of God written on their hearts. In some cases, Christians may repeatedly and earnestly plead with God for &ldquo;victory&rdquo; over supposed sins that are in fact no sins at all, yet no &ldquo;victory&rdquo; will be given, for the attitude or action in question is in fact not a sin and is not displeasing to God. Great discouragement in prayer and frustration in the Christian life generally may be the outcome.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In other cases, continued or even increasing disobedience to these new &ldquo;sins&rdquo; will result, together with a false sense of guilt and a resulting alienation from God. Often there arises an increasingly uncompromising and legalistic insistence on these new rules on the part of those who <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> follow them, and genuine fellowship among believers in the church will fade away. Evangelism will often be stifled, for the silent proclamation of the gospel that comes from the lives of believers will at least <span style="font-style:italic;">seem</span> (to outsiders) to include the additional requirement that one must fit this uniform pattern of life in order to become a member of the body of Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		One clear example of such an addition to the commands of Scripture is found in the opposition of the Roman Catholic Church to &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; methods of birth control, a policy that finds no valid support in Scripture. Widespread disobedience, alienation, and false guilt have been the result. Yet such is the propensity of human nature to make such rules that other examples can probably be found in the written or unwritten traditions of almost every denomination.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		6. The sufficiency of Scripture also tells us that <span style="font-style:italic;">nothing is required of us by God that is not commanded in Scripture either explicitly or by implication</span>. This reminds us that the focus of our search for God&rsquo;s will ought to be on Scripture, rather than on seeking guidance through prayer for changed circumstances or altered feelings or direct guidance from the Holy Spirit apart from Scripture. It also means that if someone <span style="font-style:italic;">claims</span> to have a message from God telling us what we ought to do, we need never assume that it is sin to disobey such a message unless it can be confirmed by the application of Scripture itself to our situation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The discovery of this great truth could bring tremendous joy and peace to the lives of thousands of Christians who, spending countless hours seeking God&rsquo;s will outside of Scripture, are often uncertain about whether they have found it. In fact, many Christians today have very little confidence in their ability to discover God&rsquo;s will with any degree of certainty. Thus, there is little striving to do God&rsquo;s will (for who can know it?) and little growth in holiness before God.

		The opposite ought to be true. Christians who are convinced of the sufficiency of Scripture should begin eagerly to seek and find God&rsquo;s will in Scripture. They <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 134  </span>should be eagerly and regularly growing in obedience to God, knowing great freedom and peace in the Christian life. Then they would be able to say with the psalmist:

		7. The sufficiency of Scripture reminds us that in our doctrinal and ethical teaching we should <span style="font-style:italic;">emphasize what Scripture emphasizes and be content with what God has told us in Scripture</span>. There are some subjects about which God has told us little or nothing in the Bible. We must remember that &ldquo;The secret things belong to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> our God&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt29.29">Deut. 29:29</a>) and that God has revealed to us in Scripture exactly what he deemed right for us. We must accept this and not think that Scripture is something less than it should be, or begin to wish that God had given us much more information about subjects on which there are very few scriptural references. Of course, there will be some situations where we are confronted with a particular problem that requires a great deal of attention, far greater than the emphasis that it receives in the teaching of Scripture. But those situations should be relatively infrequent and should not be representative of the general course of our lives or ministries.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		It is characteristic of many cults that they emphasize obscure portions or teachings of Scripture (one thinks of the Mormon emphasis on baptism for the dead, a subject that is mentioned in only one verse in the Bible [<a href="logosref:Bible.1Co15.29">1 Cor. 15:29</a>], in a phrase whose exact meaning is apparently impossible now to determine with certainty). But a similar error was made by an entire generation of liberal New Testament scholars in the earlier part of this century, who devoted most of their scholarly lives to a futile search for the sources &ldquo;behind&rdquo; our present gospel narratives or to a search for the &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; sayings of Jesus.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Unfortunately, a similar pattern has too often occurred among evangelicals within various denominations. The doctrinal matters that have divided evangelical Protestant denominations from one another have almost uniformly been matters on which the Bible places relatively little emphasis, and matters in which our conclusions must be drawn from skillful inference much more than from direct biblical statements. For example, abiding denominational differences have occurred or have been maintained over the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; form of church government, the exact nature of Christ&rsquo;s presence in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the exact sequence of the events surrounding Christ&rsquo;s return, the categories of persons who should be admitted to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the way in which God planned that the merits of Christ&rsquo;s death would be applied to believers and not applied to unbelievers, the proper subjects for baptism, the correct understanding of the &ldquo;baptism in the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and so forth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		We should not say that these issues are all unimportant, nor should we say that Scripture gives no solution to any of them (indeed, with respect to many of them a specific solution will be defended in subsequent chapters of this book). However, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 135  </span>since all of these topics receive <span style="font-style:italic;">relatively little direct emphasis in Scripture</span> it is ironic and tragic that denominational leaders will so often give much of their lives to defending precisely the minor doctrinal points that make their denominations different from others. Is such effort really motivated by a desire to bring unity of understanding to the church, or might it stem in some measure from human pride, a desire to retain power over others, and an attempt at self-justification, which is displeasing to God and ultimately unedifying to the church?

		Questions for Personal Application
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		1. In the process of growing in the Christian life and deepening your relationship with God, approximately how much emphasis have you placed on reading the Bible itself and how much on reading other Christian books? In seeking to know God&rsquo;s will for your daily life, what is the relative emphasis you have put on reading Scripture itself and on reading other Christian books? Do you think the doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture will cause you to place more emphasis on reading Scripture itself?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		2. What are some of the doctrinal or moral questions you are wondering about? Has this chapter increased your confidence in the ability of Scripture to provide a clear answer for some of those questions?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		3. Have you ever wished that the Bible would say more than it does about a certain subject? Or less? What do you think motivated that wish? After reading this chapter, how would you approach someone who expressed such a wish today? How is God&rsquo;s wisdom shown in the fact that he chose not to make the Bible a great deal longer or a great deal shorter than it actually is?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		4. If the Bible contains everything we need God to tell us for obeying him perfectly, what is the role of the following in helping us to find God&rsquo;s will for ourselves: advice from others; sermons or Bible classes; our consciences; our feelings; the leading of the Holy Spirit as we sense him prompting our inward desires and subjective impressions; changes in circumstances; the gift of prophecy (if you think it can function today)?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		5. In the light of this chapter, how would you find God&rsquo;s &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; will for your life? Is it possible that there would be more than one &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; choice in many decisions we make? (Consider <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps1.3">Ps. 1:3</a> and <a href="logosref:Bible.1Co7.39">1 Cor. 7:39</a> in seeking an answer.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		6. Have there been times when you have understood the principles of Scripture well enough with regard to a specific situation but have not known the facts of the situation well enough to know how to apply those scriptural principles correctly? In seeking to know God&rsquo;s will, can there be any other things we need to know except (a) the teaching of Scripture and (b) the facts of the situation in question, together with (c) skill in applying (a) to (b) correctly? What then is the role of prayer in seeking guidance? What should we pray for?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Few if any hymns deal specifically with the sufficiency of Scripture, perhaps because Christians have failed to realize the great comfort and peace that this doctrine brings to the Christian life. But the first verse of the following hymn contains a statement of this doctrine. It begins by telling us that God has laid a firm foundation for our faith in his Word. Then it says, &ldquo;What more can he say than to you he hath said …?&rdquo; The rich and full promises of God throughout Scripture are sufficient for our every need in every circumstance. This should be great cause for rejoicing! The subsequent verses contain quotations, paraphrases, and allusions to promises of God that are scattered throughout Scripture, many of them from Isaiah. Verses 2&ndash;6 are all written as sentences that are spoken by God to us, and when we sing them we should think of ourselves singing the words of God&rsquo;s promises to others in the congregation for their comfort and encouragement.

		<p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp; This is not meant to imply that subjective impressions of God&rsquo;s will are useless or that they should be ignored. That would suggest almost a deistic view of God&rsquo;s (non-)involvement in the lives of his children and a rather mechanical, impersonal view of guidance. God can and indeed does use subjective impressions of his will to remind and encourage us and often to prompt our thoughts in the right direction in many rapid decisions that we make throughout the day&mdash;and it is Scripture itself that tells us about these subjective factors in guidance (see <a href="logosref:Bible.Ac16.6-7">Acts 16:6&ndash;7</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro8.9">Rom. 8:9</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro8.14">14</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro8.16">16</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Ga5.16-18">Gal. 5:16&ndash;18</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Ga5.25">25</a>). Yet these verses on the sufficiency of Scripture teach us that such subjective impressions can only <span style="font-style:italic;">remind</span> us of moral commands that are already in Scripture, or bring to mind facts that we (in theory at least) could have known or did know otherwise; they can never add to the commands of Scripture, or replace Scripture in defining what God&rsquo;s will is, or equal Scripture in authority in our lives.Because people from all kinds of Christian traditions have made serious mistakes when they felt confident that God was &ldquo;leading them&rdquo; to make a particular decision, it is important to remember that, except where an explicit text of Scripture applies directly to a situation, we can never have 100 percent certainty in this life that we know what God&rsquo;s will is in a situation. We can only have varying degrees of confidence in different situations. Though our ability to discern God&rsquo;s will should increase as we grow in Christian maturity, we will inevitably make some mistakes. In this regard, I have found helpful a sentence from Edmund Clowney: &ldquo;The degree of certainty we have with regard to God&rsquo;s will in a situation is directly proportional to the degree of clarity we have as to how the Word of God applies to the situation&rdquo; (from a personal conversation, November 1992).</p><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp; The primary reference of this verse is of course to the book of Revelation itself, but its placement here at the very end of the only book that could come last in the New Testament canon can hardly be accidental. Thus, a secondary application of this verse to the entire canon does not seem inappropriate (see the discussion in chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.1.3.0.0.0.0.0">3</a>, pp. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.pp_64-65">64&ndash;65</a>).</p><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp; See chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.6.52.0.0.0.0.0">52</a>, pp. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.pp_1039-1042">1039&ndash;42</a>, on the possibility of some kinds of revelation from God continuing today when the canon is closed, and especially chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.6.53.0.0.0.0.0">53</a>, pp. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.pp_1049-1061">1049&ndash;61</a>, on the gift of prophecy.</p><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp; In fact, the more responsible spokesmen for the modern charismatic movement seem generally to agree with this caution: see Wayne Grudem, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today</span> (Eastbourne, England: Kingsway, and Westchester, Ill.: Crossway, 1988), pp. 110&ndash;12; 245&ndash;50.</p><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp; I do not wish to imply at this point that I am adopting a &ldquo;cessationist&rdquo; view of spiritual gifts (that is, a view that holds that certain gifts, such as prophecy and speaking in tongues, ceased when the apostles died). I only wish at this point to state that there is a danger in explicitly or even implicitly giving these gifts a status that effectively challenges the authority or the sufficiency of Scripture in Christians&rsquo; lives. More detailed discussion of these gifts is given in chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.6.53.0.0.0.0.0">53</a> below, and in Wayne Grudem, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today</span> (see n. 4 above).</p><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp; Of course, human societies such as nations, churches, families, etc. can make rules for the conduct of their own affairs (such as &ldquo;Children in this family may not watch television on weeknights&rdquo;). No such rule can be found in Scripture, nor is it likely that such a rule could be demonstrated by implication from the principles of Scripture. Yet obedience to these rules is required by God because Scripture tells us to be subject to governing authorities (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ro13.1-7">Rom. 13:1&ndash;7</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Pe2.13-3.6">1 Peter 2:13&ndash;3:6</a>; et al.). A denial of the sufficiency of Scripture would occur only if someone attempted to give the rule a generalized application outside of the situation in which it should appropriately function (&ldquo;No member of our church should watch TV on weeknights&rdquo; or &ldquo;No Christian should watch TV on weeknights&rdquo;). In such a case it has become not a rule for conduct in one specific situation but a moral command apparently intended to apply to all Christians no matter what their situation. We are not free to add such rules to Scripture and to attempt to impose them on all the believers over whom we have influence, nor can the church as a whole attempt to do this. (Here again, Roman Catholics would differ and would say that God gives to the church the authority to impose moral rules in addition to Scripture on all the members of the church.)</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;">NDT</span>&nbsp; <span style="font-style:italic;">NDT</span>&mdash;<span style="font-style:italic;">New Dictionary of Theology.</span> S.B.

		Explanation and Scriptural Basis
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Anyone who has begun to read the Bible seriously will realize that some parts can be understood very easily while other parts seem puzzling. In fact, very early in the history of the church Peter reminded his readers that some parts of Paul&rsquo;s epistles were difficult to understand: &ldquo;So also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, speaking of this as he does in all his letters. There are some things in them <span style="font-style:italic;">hard to understand</span> which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other scriptures&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Pe3.15-16">2 Peter 3:15&ndash;16</a>). We must admit therefore that not all parts of Scripture are able to be understood easily.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		But it would be a mistake to think that most of Scripture or Scripture in general is difficult to understand. In fact, the Old Testament and New Testament frequently affirm that Scripture is written in such a way that its teachings are able to be understood by ordinary believers. Even in Peter&rsquo;s statement just quoted, the context is an appeal to the teachings of Paul&rsquo;s letter, which Peter&rsquo;s readers had read and understood (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Pe3.15">2 Peter 3:15</a>). In fact, Peter assigns some moral blame to those who twist these passages &ldquo;to their own destruction.&rdquo; And he does not say that there are things impossible to understand, but only difficult to understand.

		A. The Bible Frequently Affirms Its Own Clarity
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The Bible&rsquo;s clarity and the responsibility of believers generally to read it and understand it are often emphasized. In a very familiar passage, Moses tells the people of Israel:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">
		And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart; and <span style="font-style:italic;">you shall teach them diligently to your children</span> and shall <span style="font-style:italic;">talk of them</span> when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt6.6-7">Deut. 6:6&ndash;7</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt;" lang="en-US">
		All the people of Israel were expected to be able to understand the words of Scripture well enough to be able to &ldquo;teach them diligently&rdquo; to their children. This teaching would not have consisted merely of rote memorization devoid of understanding, for the people of Israel were to <span style="font-style:italic;">discuss</span> the words of Scripture <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 106  </span>during their activities of sitting in the house or walking or going to bed or getting up in the morning. God expected that <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> of his people would know and be able to talk about his Word, with proper application to ordinary situations in life. Similarly, <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps1">Psalm 1</a> tells us that the &ldquo;blessed man,&rdquo; whom all the righteous in Israel were to emulate, was one who meditated on God&rsquo;s law &ldquo;day and night&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps1.2">Ps. 1:2</a>). This daily meditation assumes an ability to understand Scripture rightly on the part of those who meditate.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The character of Scripture is said to be such that even the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; can understand it rightly and be made wise by it. &ldquo;The testimony of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> is sure, <span style="font-style:italic;">making wise the simple</span>&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps19.7">Ps. 19:7</a>). Again we read, &ldquo;The unfolding of your words gives light; <span style="font-style:italic;">it imparts understanding to the simple</span>&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119.130">Ps. 119:130</a>). Here the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; person (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:16pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">פֶּתִי</span>&#x200E;, <a href="logosref:HebrewGK.HGK7343"><span style="font-size:11pt;">H7343</span></a>) is not merely one who lacks intellectual ability, but one who lacks sound judgment, who is prone to making mistakes, and who is easily led astray.<sup>1</sup>
		
			
		 God&rsquo;s Word is so understandable, so clear, that even this kind of person is made wise by it. This should be a great encouragement to all believers: no believer should think himself or herself too foolish to read Scripture and understand it sufficiently to be made wise by it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		There is a similar emphasis in the New Testament. Jesus himself, in his teachings, his conversations, and his disputes, never responds to any questions with a hint of blaming the Old Testament Scriptures for being unclear. Even while speaking to first-century people who were removed from David by 1,000 years, from Moses by about 1,500 years, and from Abraham by about 2,000 years, Jesus still assumes that such people are able to read and rightly to understand the Old Testament Scriptures.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In a day when it is common for people to tell us how hard it is to interpret Scripture rightly, we would do well to remember that not once in the Gospels do we ever hear Jesus saying anything like this: &ldquo;I see how your problem arose&mdash;the Scriptures are not very clear on that subject.&rdquo; Instead, whether he is speaking to scholars or untrained common people, his responses always assume that the blame for misunderstanding any teaching of Scripture is not to be placed on the Scriptures themselves, but on those who misunderstand or fail to accept what is written. Again and again he answers questions with statements like, &ldquo;Have you not read …&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Mt12.3">Matt. 12:3</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt12.5">5</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt19.4">19:4</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt22.31">22:31</a>), &ldquo;Have you never read in the scriptures …&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Mt21.42">Matt. 21:42</a>), or even, &ldquo;You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Mt22.29">Matt. 22:29</a>; cf
		
			
		. <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt9.13">Matt. 9:13</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt12.7">12:7</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt15.3">15:3</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt21.13">21:13</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn3.10">John 3:10</a>; et al.).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, most of the New Testament epistles are written not to church leaders but to entire congregations. Paul writes, &ldquo;To the church of God which is at Corinth&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.1Co1.2">1 Cor. 1:2</a>), &ldquo;To the churches of Galatia&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ga1.2">Gal. 1:2</a>), &ldquo;To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Php1.1">Phil. 1:1</a>), and so forth. Paul <span style="font-style:italic;">assumes</span> that his hearers will <span style="font-style:italic;">understand</span> what he writes, and he encourages the sharing of his letters with other churches: &ldquo;And when this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you read also the letter from Laodicea&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Col4.16">Col. 4:16</a>; cf
		
			
		. <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn20.30-31">John 20:30&ndash;31</a>; <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 107  </span><a href="logosref:Bible.2Co1.13">2 Cor. 1:13</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Eph3.4">Eph. 3:4</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Ti4.13">1 Tim. 4:13</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Jas1.1">James 1:1</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Jas1.22-25">22&ndash;25</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Pe1.1">1 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Pe2.2">2:2</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.2Pe1.19">2 Peter 1:19</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Jn5.13">1 John 5:13</a>).<sup>2</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="logosref:Bible.2Pe1.20">2 Peter 1:20</a> may be urged against the view of the clarity of Scripture explained in this chapter. The verse says, &ldquo;no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one&rsquo;s own interpretation,&rdquo; and someone may claim that this means that ordinary believers are unable to interpret Scripture rightly for themselves. It is unlikely, however, that this implication should be drawn from <a href="logosref:Bible.2Pe1.20">2 Peter 1:20</a>, for the verse is probably discussing the <span style="font-style:italic;">origin</span> and not the interpretation of Scripture. Thus the NIV
		
			
		 translates it, &ldquo;no prophecy of Scripture <span style="font-style:italic;">came about by</span> the prophet&rsquo;s own interpretation.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup>
		
			
		 Furthermore, even if the verse were understood as speaking of interpreting Scripture, it would be saying that the interpretation of Scripture must be done within the fellowship of believers and not merely as a personal activity. It still would not be implying that authoritative interpreters are needed to ascertain the true meaning of Scripture, but simply that reading and understanding Scripture should not be carried out entirely in isolation from other Christians.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Lest we think that understanding the Bible was somehow easier for first-century Christians than for us, it is important to realize that in many instances the New Testament epistles were written to churches that had large proportions of Gentile Christians. They were relatively new Christians who had no previous background in any kind of Christian society, and who had little or no prior understanding of the history and culture of Israel. Nevertheless, the New Testament authors show no hesitancy in expecting even these Gentile Christians to be able to read a translation of the Old Testament in their own language and to understand it rightly (cf
		
			
		. <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro4.1-25">Rom. 4:1&ndash;25</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro15.4">15:4</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Co10.1-11">1 Cor. 10:1&ndash;11</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.2Ti3.16-17">2 Tim. 3:16&ndash;17</a>; et al.).

		B. The Moral and Spiritual Qualities Needed for Right Understanding
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament writers frequently state that the ability to understand Scripture rightly is more a moral and spiritual than intellectual ability: &ldquo;The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts (literally &ldquo;things&rdquo;) of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.1Co2.14">1 Cor. 2:14</a>; cf
		
			
		. <a href="logosref:Bible.1Co1.18-3.4">1:18&ndash;3:4</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.2Co3.14-16">2 Cor. 3:14&ndash;16</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.2Co4.3-4">4:3&ndash;4</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.2Co4.6">6</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Heb5.14">Heb. 5:14</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Jas1.5-6">James 1:5&ndash;6</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.2Pe3.5">2 Peter 3:5</a>; cf

Thus, although the New Testament authors affirm that the Bible <span style="font-style:italic;">in itself</span> is written clearly, they also affirm that it will not be understood rightly by those who are unwilling to receive its teachings. Scripture is able to be understood by all unbelievers who will read it sincerely seeking salvation, and by all believers who will read it while seeking God&rsquo;s help in understanding it. This is because in both cases the Holy Spirit is at work overcoming the effects of sin, which otherwise will <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 108  </span>make the truth appear to be foolish (<a href="logosref:Bible.1Co2.14">1 Cor. 2:14</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Co1.18-25">1:18&ndash;25</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Jas1.5-6">James 1:5&ndash;6</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Jas1.22-25">22&ndash;25</a>).

		C. Definition of the Clarity of Scripture
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In order to summarize this biblical material, we can affirm that the Bible is written in such a way that all things necessary for our salvation and for our Christian life and growth are very clearly set forth in Scripture. Although theologians have sometimes defined the clarity of Scripture more narrowly (by saying, for example, only that Scripture is clear in teaching the way of salvation), the many texts cited above apply to many different aspects of biblical teaching and do not seem to support any such limitation on the areas to which Scripture can be said to speak clearly. It seems more faithful to those biblical texts to define the clarity<sup>4</sup>
		
			
		 of Scripture as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">The clarity of Scripture means that the Bible is written in such a way that its teachings are able to be understood by all who will read it seeking God&rsquo;s help and being willing to follow it</span>. Once we have stated this, however, we must also recognize that many people, even God&rsquo;s people, do in fact misunderstand Scripture.

		D. Why Do People Misunderstand Scripture?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		During Jesus&rsquo; lifetime, his own disciples at times failed to understand the Old Testament and Jesus&rsquo; own teachings (see <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt15.16">Matt. 15:16</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mk4.10-13">Mark 4:10&ndash;13</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mk6.52">6:52</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mk8.14-21">8:14&ndash;21</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mk9.32">9:32</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Lk18.34">Luke 18:34</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn8.27">John 8:27</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn10.6">10:6</a>). Although sometimes this was due to the fact that they simply needed to wait for further events in the history of redemption, and especially in the life of Christ himself (see <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn12.16">John 12:16</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn13.7">13:7</a>; cf
		
			
		. <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn2.22">John 2:22</a>), there were also times when this was due to their own lack of faith or hardness of heart (<a href="logosref:Bible.Lk24.25">Luke 24:25</a>). Furthermore, there were times in the early church when Christians did not understand or agree on the teachings of the Old Testament or about the letters written by the apostles: note the process of growth in understanding concerning the implications of Gentile inclusion in the church (culminating in &ldquo;much debate&rdquo; [<a href="logosref:Bible.Ac15.7">Acts 15:7</a>] in the Jerusalem Council of <a href="logosref:Bible.Ac15">Acts 15</a>), or Peter&rsquo;s misunderstanding of this issue in <a href="logosref:Bible.Ga2.11-15">Galatians 2:11&ndash;15</a>, or the frequent doctrinal and ethical issues that had to be corrected by the New Testament epistles. In fact, throughout the history of the church, doctrinal disagreements have been many, and progress in resolving doctrinal differences has often been slow.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In order to help people to avoid making mistakes in interpreting Scripture, many Bible teachers have developed &ldquo;principles of interpretation,&rdquo; or guidelines to encourage growth in the skill of proper interpretation. The word <span style="font-style:italic;">hermeneutics</span> (from the Greek word <span style="font-family:Skolar Logos;" lang="el">ἑρμηνεύω</span> &ldquo;to interpret&rdquo;) is the more technical term for this field of study: <span style="font-style:italic;">hermeneutics is the study of correct methods of interpretation</span> (especially interpretation of Scripture).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Another technical term often used in discussions of biblical interpretation is &ldquo;exegesis,&rdquo; a term that refers more to the actual practice of interpreting Scripture, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 109  </span>not to theories and principles about how it should be done: <span style="font-style:italic;">exegesis is the process of interpreting a text of Scripture</span>. Consequently, when one studies principles of interpretation, that is &ldquo;hermeneutics,&rdquo; but when one applies those principles and begins actually explaining a biblical text, he or she is doing &ldquo;exegesis.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The existence of many disagreements about the meaning of Scripture throughout history reminds us that the doctrine of the clarity of Scripture does not imply or suggest that all believers will agree on all the teachings of Scripture. Nevertheless, it does tell us something very important&mdash;that the problem always lies not with Scripture but with ourselves. The situation is in fact similar to that of the authority of Scripture. Whereas we affirm that the words of Scripture have all the authority of God himself, we also realize that many people do not acknowledge that authority or submit themselves to it. Similarly, we affirm that all the teachings of Scripture are clear and able to be understood, but we also recognize that people often (through their own shortcomings) misunderstand what is clearly written in Scripture.

		E. Practical Encouragement From This Doctrine
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The doctrine of the clarity of Scripture therefore has a very important, and ultimately very encouraging, practical implication. It tells us that where there are areas of doctrinal or ethical disagreement (for example, over baptism or predestination or church government), there are only two possible causes for these disagreements: (1) On the one hand, it may be that we are <span style="font-style:italic;">seeking to make affirmations where Scripture itself is silent</span>. In such cases we should be more ready to admit that God has not given us the answer to our quest, and to allow for differences of viewpoint within the church. (This will often be the case with very practical questions, such as methods of evangelism or styles of Bible teaching or appropriate church size.) (2) On the other hand, it is possible that we have made <span style="font-style:italic;">mistakes in our interpretation</span> of Scripture. This could have happened because the data we used to decide a question of interpretation were inaccurate or incomplete. Or it could be because there is some personal inadequacy on our part, whether it be, for example, personal pride, or greed, or lack of faith, or selfishness, or even failure to devote enough time to prayerfully reading and studying Scripture.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		But in no case are we free to say that the teaching of the Bible on any subject is confusing or incapable of being understood correctly. In no case should we think that persistent disagreements on some subject through the history of the church mean that we will be unable to come to a correct conclusion on that subject ourselves. Rather, if a genuine concern about some such subject arises in our lives, we should sincerely ask God&rsquo;s help and then go to Scripture, searching it with all our ability, believing that God will enable us to understand rightly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This truth should give great encouragement to all Christians to read their Bibles daily and with great eagerness. We should never assume, for example, that only those who know Greek and Hebrew, or only pastors or Bible scholars, are able to understand the Bible rightly&mdash;remember that the Old Testament was written in Hebrew and that many of the Christians to whom the New Testament letters were written had no knowledge of Hebrew at all: they had to read the Old Testament in a Greek translation. Yet the New Testament authors assume that these people can read it and understand it rightly even without scholarly ability in the original <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 110  </span>language. Christians must never give up to the scholarly &ldquo;experts&rdquo; the task of interpreting Scripture: they must keep doing it every day for themselves.<sup>5</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Furthermore, even though we admit that there have been many doctrinal disagreements in the history of the church, we must not forget that there has been an amazing amount of doctrinal agreement on the most central truths of Scripture throughout the history of the church. Indeed, those who have had opportunities for fellowship with Christians in other parts of the world have discovered the remarkable fact that wherever we find a group of vital Christians, almost immediately a vast amount of agreement on all the central doctrines of the Christian faith becomes apparent. Why is this true, no matter what the society, or culture, or denominational affiliation? It is because they all have been reading and believing the same Bible, and its primary teachings have been clear.

		F. The Role of Scholars
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Is there any role then for Bible scholars or for those with specialized knowledge of Hebrew (for the Old Testament) and Greek (for the New Testament)? Certainly there is a role for them in at least four areas:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		1. They can <span style="font-style:italic;">teach</span> Scripture clearly, communicating its content to others and thus fulfilling the office of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; mentioned in the New Testament (<a href="logosref:Bible.1Co12.28">1 Cor. 12:28</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Eph4.11">Eph. 4:11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		2. They can <span style="font-style:italic;">explore</span> new areas of understanding the teachings of Scripture. This exploration will seldom (if ever) involve denial of the main teachings the church has held throughout its centuries, but it will often involve the application of Scripture to new areas of life, the answering of difficult questions that have been raised by both believers and unbelievers at each new period in history, and the continual activity of refining and making more precise the church&rsquo;s understanding of detailed points of interpretation of individual verses or matters of doctrine or ethics. Though the Bible may not seem large in comparison with the vast amount of literature in the world, it is a rich treasure-house of wisdom from God that surpasses in value all the other books that have ever been written. The process of relating its various teachings to one another, synthesizing them, and applying them to each new generation, is a greatly rewarding task that will never be completed in this age. Every scholar who deeply loves God&rsquo;s Word will soon realize that there is much more in Scripture than can be learned in any one lifetime!
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		3. They can <span style="font-style:italic;">defend</span> the teachings of the Bible against attacks by other scholars or those with specialized technical training. The role of teaching God&rsquo;s Word also at times involves correcting false teachings. One must be able not only &ldquo;to give instruction in sound doctrine&rdquo; but also &ldquo;to confute those who contradict it&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Tt1.9">Titus 1:9</a>; cf
		
			
		. <a href="logosref:Bible.2Ti2.25">2 Tim. 2:25</a>, &ldquo;correcting his opponents with gentleness&rdquo;; and <a href="logosref:Bible.Tt2.7-8">Titus 2:7&ndash;8</a>). Sometimes those who attack biblical teachings have specialized training and technical knowledge in historical, linguistic, or philosophical study, and they use <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 111  </span>that training to mount rather sophisticated attacks against the teaching of Scripture. In such cases, believers with similar specialized skills can use their training to understand and respond to such attacks. Such training is also very useful in responding to the false teachings of cults and sects. This is not to say that believers without specialized training are incapable of responding to false teaching (for most false teaching can be clearly refuted by a believer who prays and has a good knowledge of the English Bible), but rather that technical points in arguments can only be answered by those with skills in the technical areas appealed to.

		4. They can <span style="font-style:italic;">supplement</span> the study of Scripture for the benefit of the church. Bible scholars often have training that will enable them to relate the teachings of Scripture to the rich history of the church, and to make the interpretation of Scripture more precise and its meaning more vivid with a greater knowledge of the languages and cultures in which the Bible was written.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		These four functions benefit the church as a whole, and all believers should be thankful for those who perform them. However, these functions do <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> include the right to decide for the church as a whole what is true and false doctrine or what is proper conduct in a difficult situation. If such a right were the preserve of formally trained Bible scholars, then they would become a governing elite in the church, and the ordinary functioning of the government of the church as described in the New Testament would cease. The process of decision-making for the church must be left to the officers of the church, whether they are scholars or not (and, in a congregational form of church government, not only to the officers but also to the people of the church as a whole).<sup>6</sup>

		Questions for Personal Application
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		1. If the doctrine of the clarity of Scripture is true, why does there seem to be so much disagreement among Christians about the teaching of the Bible? Observing the diversity of interpretations of Scripture, some conclude, &ldquo;People can make the Bible say anything they want.&rdquo; How do you think Jesus would respond to this statement?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		2. What would happen to the church if most believers gave up reading the Bible for themselves and only listened to Bible teachers or read books about the Bible? If you thought that only expert scholars could understand the Bible rightly, what would happen to your personal reading of Scripture? Has this already happened to some extent in your life or in the lives of those you know?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		3. Do you think that there are right and wrong interpretations of most or all passages of Scripture? If you thought the Bible was generally unclear, how would your answer change? Will a conviction about the clarity of Scripture affect the care you use when studying a text of Scripture? Will it affect the way you approach Scripture when trying to gain a biblical answer to some difficult doctrinal or moral problem?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		4. <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 112  </span>If even seminary professors disagree about some Bible teaching, can other Christians ever hope to come to a correct decision on that teaching? (Give reasons for your answer.) Do you think ordinary people among the Jews at the time of Jesus had a hard time deciding whether to believe Jesus or the scholarly experts who disagreed with him? Did Jesus expect them to be able to decide?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		5. How can a pastor preach biblically based sermons each Sunday without giving the impression that only people with seminary training (like himself) are able to interpret Scripture rightly? Do you think it should ever be necessary, in a doctrinal or ethical controversy, for a Bible scholar to speak in a church and base his main arguments on special meanings of Greek or Hebrew words that the church members themselves are unable to evaluate or take issue with personally? Is there an appropriate way for a scholar to use such technical knowledge in popular writing or speaking?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		6. Church leaders at the time of Martin Luther said they wanted to keep the Bible in Latin to prevent the common people from reading it and then misinterpreting it. Evaluate this argument. Why do you think Martin Luther was so anxious to translate the Bible into German? Why do you think church leaders in previous centuries have persecuted and even killed men&mdash;like William Tyndale in England&mdash;who were translating the Bible into the language of the people? Why is the task of Bible translation into other languages so important a part of the work of missions?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		7. Does the doctrine of the clarity of Scripture mean that the New Testament can be fully understood by people who do not have access to an Old Testament?

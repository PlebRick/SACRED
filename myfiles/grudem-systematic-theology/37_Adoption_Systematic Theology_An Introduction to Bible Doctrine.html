	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In regeneration God gives us new spiritual life within. In justification God gives us right legal standing before him. But in adoption God makes us members of his family. Therefore, the biblical teaching on adoption focuses much more on the personal relationships that salvation gives us with God and with his people.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Scriptural Evidence for Adoption</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define adoption as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">Adoption is an act of God whereby he makes us members of his family</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		John mentions adoption at the beginning of his gospel, where he says, &ldquo;But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power <span style="font-style:italic;">to become children of God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.12">John 1:12</a>). By contrast, those who do not believe in Christ are not children of God or adopted into his family, but are &ldquo;children of wrath&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.3">Eph. 2:3</a>) and &ldquo;sons of disobedience&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.2">Eph. 2:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.6">5:6</a>). Although those Jews who rejected Christ tried to claim that God was their father (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn8.41">John 8:41</a>), Jesus told them, &ldquo;If God were your Father, you would love me … You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&rsquo;s desires&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn8.42-44">John 8:42&ndash;44</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament epistles bear repeated testimony to the fact that we are now God&rsquo;s children in a special sense, members of his family. Paul says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For all who are led by the Spirit of God are <span style="font-style:italic;">sons of God</span>. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the <span style="font-style:italic;">spirit of sonship</span>. When we cry, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo; it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are <span style="font-style:italic;">children of God</span> and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.14-17">Rom. 8:14&ndash;17</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But if we are God&rsquo;s children, are we then related to one another as family members? Certainly so. In fact, this adoption into God&rsquo;s family makes us partakers together in <span style="font-style:italic;">one family</span> even with the believing Jews of the Old Testament, for Paul says that we are Abraham&rsquo;s children as well: &ldquo;Not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but &ldquo;Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.&rsquo; This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 737  </span>God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.7-8">Rom. 9:7&ndash;8</a>). He further explains in Galatians, &ldquo;Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise … we are not children of the slave but of the free woman&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.28">Gal. 4:28</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.31">31</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.6">1 Peter 3:6</a>, where Peter sees believing women as daughters of Sarah in the new covenant).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul explains that this status of adoption as God&rsquo;s children was not fully realized in the old covenant. He says that &ldquo;before faith came, we were confined under the law … the law was our custodian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian; for <span style="font-style:italic;">in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Christ Jesus</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> you are all sons of God, through faith</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.23-26">Gal. 3:23&ndash;26</a>). This is not to say that the Old Testament completely omitted talk of God as our Father, for God did call himself the Father of the children of Israel and called them his children in several places (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.13">Ps. 103:13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.6-7">Isa. 43:6&ndash;7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mal1.6">Mal. 1:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mal2.10">2:10</a>). But even though there was a consciousness of God as Father to the people of Israel, the full benefits and privileges of membership in God&rsquo;s family, and the full realization of that membership, did not come until Christ came and the Spirit of the Son of God was poured into our hearts, bearing witness with our spirit that we were God&rsquo;s children.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What evidence do we see in our lives that we are God&rsquo;s children? Paul sees clear evidence in the fact that the Holy Spirit bears witness in our hearts that we are God&rsquo;s children: &ldquo;But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive <span style="font-style:italic;">adoption as sons</span>. And because <span style="font-style:italic;">you are sons</span> God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rsquo; So through God you are no longer a slave <span style="font-style:italic;">but a son</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">if a son then an heir</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.4-7">Gal. 4:4&ndash;7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		John&rsquo;s first epistle places much emphasis on our status as children of God: &ldquo;See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called <span style="font-style:italic;">children of God;</span> and so we are … Beloved, we are God&rsquo;s children now&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.1-2">1 John 3:1&ndash;2</a>; John frequently calls his readers &ldquo;children&rdquo; or &ldquo;little children&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although Jesus does call us his &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.12">Heb. 2:12</a> NIV) and he is therefore in one sense our older brother in God&rsquo;s family (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.14">Heb. 2:14</a>), and can be called &ldquo;the firstborn among many brethren&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.29">Rom. 8:29</a>), he is nevertheless careful to make a clear distinction between the way in which God is our heavenly Father and the way in which he relates to God the Father. He says to Mary Magdalene, &ldquo;I am ascending <span style="font-style:italic;">to my Father and your Father</span> to my God and your God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.17">John 20:17</a>), thus making a clear distinction between the far greater and eternal sense in which God is his Father, and the sense in which God is our Father.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although the New Testament says that we are <span style="font-style:italic;">now</span> God&rsquo;s children (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.2">1 John 3:2</a>), we should also note that there is another sense in which our adoption is still future because we will not receive the full benefits and privileges of adoption until Christ returns and we have new resurrection bodies. Paul speaks of this later, fuller sense of adoption when he says, &ldquo;Not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons, <span style="font-style:italic;">the redemption of our bodies</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.23">Rom. 8:23</a>). Here Paul sees the receiving of new <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 738  </span>resurrection bodies as the fulfillment of our privileges of adoption, so much so that he can refer to it as our &ldquo;adoption as sons.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Adoption Follows Conversion and Is an Outcome of Saving Faith</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We might initially think that we would become God&rsquo;s children by regeneration, since the imagery of being &ldquo;born again&rdquo; in regeneration makes us think of children being born into a human family. But the New Testament never connects adoption with regeneration: indeed, the idea of <span style="font-style:italic;">adoption</span> is opposite to the idea of being born into a family!
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Rather, the New Testament connects adoption with saving faith, and says that in response to our trusting in Christ, God has adopted us into his family. Paul says, &ldquo;In Christ Jesus you are all <span style="font-style:italic;">sons of God, through faith</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.23-26">Gal. 3:23&ndash;26</a>). And John writes, &ldquo;But to all who received him, who <span style="font-style:italic;">believed in his name</span> he gave power <span style="font-style:italic;">to become children of God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.12">John 1:12</a>). These two verses make it clear that adoption follows conversion and is God&rsquo;s response to our faith.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One objection to this might be brought from Paul&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Because you are sons</span> God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.6">Gal. 4:6</a>). Someone might understand this verse to mean that first God adopted us as sons and second he gave us the Holy Spirit to bring regeneration to our hearts. But a few verses earlier Paul had said that we have become sons of God &ldquo;through faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.26">Gal. 3:26</a>). Therefore Paul&rsquo;s statement in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.6">Galatians 4:6</a> is best understood not to refer to the giving of the Holy Spirit in regeneration, but rather to an additional activity of the Holy Spirit in which he begins to bear witness with our spirit and to assure us that we are members of God&rsquo;s family. This work of the Holy Spirit gives us <span style="font-style:italic;">assurance</span> of our adoption, and it is in this sense that Paul says that, after we have become sons, God causes his Holy Spirit within our hearts to cry, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo; (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.15-16">Rom 8:15&ndash;16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. Adoption Is Distinct From Justification</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although adoption is a privilege that comes to us at the time we become Christians (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.12">John 1:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.26">Gal 3:26</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.1-2">1 John 3:1&ndash;2</a>), nevertheless, it is a privilege that is distinct from justification and distinct from regeneration. In regeneration we are made spiritually alive, able to relate to God in prayer and worship and able to hear his Word with receptive hearts. But it is possible that God could have creatures who are spiritually alive and yet are not members of his family and do not share the special privileges of family members&mdash;angels, for example, apparently fall into that category. Therefore, it would have been possible for God to decide to give us regeneration without the great privileges of adoption into his family.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 739  </span>Moreover, God could have given us justification without the privileges of adoption into his family, for he could have forgiven our sins and given us right legal standing before him without making us his children. It is important to realize this because it helps us to recognize how great are our privileges in adoption. Regeneration has to do with our spiritual life within. Justification has to do with our standing before God&rsquo;s law. But adoption has to do with our <span style="font-style:italic;">relationship</span> with God as our Father, and in adoption we are given many of the greatest blessings that we will know for all eternity. When we begin to realize the excellence of these blessings, and when we appreciate that God has no obligation to give us any of them, then we will be able to exclaim with the apostle John, &ldquo;See <span style="font-style:italic;">what love</span> the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.1">1 John 3:1</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. The Privileges of Adoption</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The benefits or privileges that accompany adoption are seen, first, in the way God relates to us, and then also in the way we relate to one another as brothers and sisters in God&rsquo;s family.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One of the greatest privileges of our adoption is being able to speak to God and <span style="font-style:italic;">relate to him as a</span> good and loving <span style="font-style:italic;">Father</span>. We are to pray, &ldquo;Our Father who art in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.9">Matt. 6:9</a>), and we are to realize that we are &ldquo;no longer slaves, but sons&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.7">Gal. 4:7</a>). Therefore, we now relate to God not as a slave relates to a slave master, but as a child relates to his or her father. In fact, God gives us an <span style="font-style:italic;">internal witness from the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span> that causes us instinctively to call God our Father. &ldquo;When we cry, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rsquo; it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.15-16">Rom. 8:15&ndash;16</a>). This relationship to God as our Father is the foundation of many other blessings of the Christian life, and it becomes the primary way in which we relate to God. Certainly it is true that God is our Creator, our judge, our Lord and Master, our teacher, our provider and protector, and the one who by his providential care sustains our existence. But the role that is most intimate, and the role that conveys the highest privileges of fellowship with God for eternity, is his role as our heavenly Father.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that God relates to us as Father shows very clearly that he <span style="font-style:italic;">loves us</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.1">1 John 3:1</a>), that he <span style="font-style:italic;">understands us</span> (&ldquo;As a father has compassion on his children, so the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> has compassion on those who fear him; for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust&rdquo; [<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.13-14">Ps. 103:13&ndash;14</a> NIV]), and that he <span style="font-style:italic;">takes care of our needs</span> (&ldquo;For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.32">Matt. 6:32</a>). Moreover, in his role as our Father, God <span style="font-style:italic;">gives us many good gifts:</span> &ldquo;If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.11">Matt. 7:11</a>). He especially <span style="font-style:italic;">gives us</span> the gift of <span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span> to comfort us and to empower us for ministry and for living the Christian life (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk11.13">Luke 11:13</a>). In fact, it is not only gifts in this life that God gives <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 740  </span>to us, but he also gives us a great <span style="font-style:italic;">inheritance in heaven</span> because we have become joint heirs with Christ. Paul says, &ldquo;You are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son then an heir&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.7">Gal. 4:7</a>); we are in fact &ldquo;heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.17">Rom. 8:17</a>). As heirs we have the rights to a great eternal &ldquo;inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.4">1 Peter 1:4</a>). All the great privileges and blessings of heaven are laid up for us and put at our disposal because we are children of the King, members of the royal family, princes and princesses who will reign with Christ over the new heavens and new earth (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.26-27">Rev. 2:26&ndash;27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.21">3:21</a>). As a foretaste of this great privilege, angels are even now sent to minister to us and serve us (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.14">Heb. 1:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is in the context of this relationship with God as our heavenly Father that we are to understand the prayer that Jesus told his disciples to pray daily, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Our Father</span> who art in heaven … <span style="font-style:italic;">forgive</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> us our sins</span> as we also have forgiven those who sin against us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.9-12">Matt. 6:9&ndash;12</a>, author&rsquo;s translation). This daily prayer for forgiveness of sins is not a prayer that God would give us justification again and again throughout our lives, for justification is a one-time event that occurs immediately after we trust in Christ with saving faith. Rather, the prayer for forgiveness of sins each day is a prayer that God&rsquo;s fatherly relationship with us, which has been disrupted by sin that displeased him, be restored, and that he relate to us once again as a Father who delights in his children whom he loves. The prayer, &ldquo;Forgive us our sins,&rdquo; therefore, is one in which we are relating not to God as eternal judge of the universe, but to God as a Father. It is a prayer in which we wish to restore the open fellowship with our Father that has been broken because of sin (see also <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn1.9">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.19-22">3:19&ndash;22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The privilege of being <span style="font-style:italic;">led by the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span> is also a benefit of adoption. Paul indicates that this is a moral benefit whereby the Holy Spirit puts in us desires to obey God and live according to his will. He says, &ldquo;All who are <span style="font-style:italic;">led by the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of God</span> are <span style="font-style:italic;">sons of God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.14">Rom. 8:14</a>), and he gives this as the <span style="font-style:italic;">reason</span> Christians should &ldquo;put to death the deeds of the body&rdquo; by means of the Holy Spirit working within them (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.13">13</a>; note &ldquo;for&rdquo; at the beginning of v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.14">14</a>). He sees the Holy Spirit as leading and guiding God&rsquo;s children in paths of obedience to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another privilege of adoption into God&rsquo;s family, though we do not always recognize it as a privilege, is the fact that God <span style="font-style:italic;">disciplines us</span> as his children. &ldquo;My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor lose courage when you are punished by him. For the Lord disciplines him whom he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.5-6">Heb. 12:5&ndash;6</a>, quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr3.11-12">Prov. 3:11&ndash;12</a>). The author of Hebrews explains, &ldquo;God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?… he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.7">Heb. 12:7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.10">10</a>). Just as earthly children grow in obedience and righteousness when they are disciplined properly by their earthly fathers, so we grow in righteousness and holiness when we are disciplined by our heavenly Father.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Related to the fatherly discipline of God is the fact that, as children of God and joint heirs with Christ, we have the <span style="font-style:italic;">privilege of sharing both in his sufferings and in his subsequent glory</span>. Just as it was &ldquo;necessary that the Christ should suffer these <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 741  </span>things and enter into his glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.26">Luke 24:26</a>), so God gives us the privilege of walking the same path that Christ walked, enduring sufferings in this life that we may also receive great glory in the life to come: &ldquo;if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, <span style="font-style:italic;">provided we suffer with him</span> in order that we may also be <span style="font-style:italic;">glorified with him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.17">Rom. 8:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition to these great privileges that concern our relationship to God and fellowship with him, we also have privileges of adoption that affect the way that we relate to each other and affect our own personal conduct. Because we are God&rsquo;s children, our relationship with each other is far deeper and more intimate than the relationship that angels, for example, have to one another, for we are all <span style="font-style:italic;">members of one family</span>. Many times the New Testament refers to Christians as &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; and &ldquo;sisters&rdquo; in Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.13">Rom. 1:13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.12">8:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.10">1 Cor. 1:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.8">6:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.2">James 1:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.50">Matt. 12:50</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.1">Rom. 16:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.15">1 Cor. 7:15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Phm2">Philem. 1:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.15">James 2:15</a>). In addition to this, the many verses in which entire churches are referred to as &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; should not be understood to refer to the men in the congregation only, but are rather generic references to the whole church, and, except where the context explicitly indicates otherwise, should be taken to mean &ldquo;brothers and sisters in the Lord.&rdquo; The designation &ldquo;brother&rdquo; is so common in the epistles that it seems to be the predominant way in which the New Testament authors refer to the other Christians to whom they are writing. This indicates the strong consciousness they had of the nature of the church as the family of God. In fact, Paul tells Timothy to relate to the church at Ephesus, and to the individuals within the church, as he would relate to members of a large family: &ldquo;Do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as you would a <span style="font-style:italic;">father;</span> treat younger men like <span style="font-style:italic;">brothers</span> older women like <span style="font-style:italic;">mothers</span> younger women like <span style="font-style:italic;">sisters</span> in all purity&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.1-2">1 Tim. 5:1&ndash;2</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This concept of the church as God&rsquo;s family should give us a new perspective on the work of the church; it is &ldquo;family work,&rdquo; and the various members of the family never should compete with each other or hinder one another in their efforts, but should encourage one another and be thankful for whatever good or whatever progress comes to any member of the family, for all are contributing to the good of the family and the honor of God our Father. In fact, just as members of an earthly family often have times of joy and fellowship when they work together on a single project, so our times of working together in building up the church ought to be times of great joy and fellowship with one another. Moreover, just as members of an earthly family honor their parents and fulfill the purpose of a family most when they eagerly welcome any brothers or sisters who are newly adopted into that family, so we ought to welcome new members of the family of Christ eagerly and with love.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another aspect of our membership in God&rsquo;s family is that we, as God&rsquo;s children, are to <span style="font-style:italic;">imitate our Father</span> in heaven in all our conduct. Paul says, &ldquo;be imitators of God, as beloved children&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.1">Eph. 5:1</a>). Peter echoes this theme when he says, &ldquo;As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct; since it is written, &ldquo;You shall be holy, for I am holy&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.14-16">1 Peter 1:14&ndash;16</a>). Both Peter and <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 742  </span>Paul realize that it is natural for children to imitate their earthly fathers. They appeal to this natural sense that children have in order to remind us that we are to imitate our heavenly Father&mdash;indeed, this should be something we naturally want to do and delight in. If God our Father in heaven is holy, we should be holy as obedient children.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we walk in paths of righteous conduct we <span style="font-style:italic;">honor our heavenly Father</span> and bring glory to him. When we act in a way that is pleasing to God, we are to do so that others &ldquo;may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.16">Matt. 5:16</a>). Paul encourages the Philippians to maintain pure conduct before unbelievers &ldquo;that you may be blameless and innocent, <span style="font-style:italic;">children of God</span> without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.15">Phil. 2:15</a>). Indeed, a consistent pattern of moral conduct is also evidence that we are truly children of God. John says, &ldquo;By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.10">1 John 3:10</a>).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. Look back over the list of privileges that come with our adoption as God&rsquo;s children. Had you previously thought of these as automatically yours because you had been born again? Can you describe what our eternal life would be like if we had regeneration and justification and many of the other privileges that come with salvation, but no adoption into God&rsquo;s family? Now how do you feel about the fact that God has adopted you into his family compared with the way you felt before reading this chapter?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. Has your relationship with your own human family become better or more difficult as a result of your becoming a Christian? If your relationship with your earthly family has become more difficult, how have you found <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk10.29-30">Mark 10:29&ndash;30</a> to be true in your life as a Christian?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Sometimes people who have had unloving or cruel earthly fathers have found that their background creates difficulty in their thinking about God and relating to him as a heavenly Father. How can <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.10">Hebrews 12:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.11">Matthew 7:11</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk11.13">Luke 11:13</a>, which contrast sinful earthly fathers with our perfect Father in heaven, be of help in that situation? Might <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.18">1 Peter 1:18</a> be helpful in this situation as well? What can a person who has had a cruel and unloving earthly father do to gain a better and better appreciation of who God is and what kind of Father he is? Do you think that any of the people who became Christians in the first century had cruel and unloving fathers, or no living fathers at all? What teachings of the Old Testament would have helped them at this point? Do you think that people who have had evil earthly fathers have a God-given inward sense of what a good father would be like?

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 743  </span> 4. Think of the people who are members of your church. Has this chapter helped you to think of them more as your brothers and sisters (or if they are older, as those who are like &ldquo;fathers&rdquo; and &ldquo;mothers&rdquo; to you)? How do you think an added appreciation of this idea of the church as a family would be helpful to your church? How could you encourage a greater appreciation of this idea?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. Does your church have any sense of competition with other churches that might be overcome by greater appreciation of the doctrine of adoption?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 6. In the human family, when one of the children commits a crime and is publicly punished for it, the entire family suffers shame. On the other hand, when a family member is honored for an outstanding achievement, the entire family is proud and rejoices. How does this analogy of events in a human family make you feel about your own personal level of holiness in life, and the way it reflects on the other members of your spiritual family? How does it make you feel about the need for personal holiness among your brothers and sisters in the church? Do you personally have a strong inward desire to imitate your heavenly Father in your conduct (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.1">Eph. 5:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.14-16">1 Peter 1:14&ndash;16</a>)?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 7. Do you sense the Holy Spirit within you bearing witness with your spirit that your are a child of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.15-16">Rom. 8:15&ndash;16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.6">Gal. 4:6</a>)? Can you describe what that sense is like?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 8. Do you sense any discrimination against Christians of other races or other social or economic positions? Can you understand how the doctrine of adoption should obliterate such distinctions in the church (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.26-28">Gal. 3:26&ndash;28</a>)? Can you also see how the doctrine of adoption means that neither men nor women should think of the other sex as more important or less important in the church (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.28">Gal. 3:28</a>)?

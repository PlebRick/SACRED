	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The previous chapters have discussed the nature of God and his creation of the universe, the spiritual beings that he created, and his relationship to the world in terms of working miracles and answering prayer. In this next section, we focus on the pinnacle of God&rsquo;s creative activity, his creation of human beings, both male and female, to be more like him than anything else he has made. We will consider first God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man and the nature of man as God created him to be (chapters <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.3.21.0.0.0.0.0">21&ndash;23</a>). Then we will look at the nature of sin and man&rsquo;s disobedience to God (chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.3.24.0.0.0.0.0">24</a>). Finally, we will examine the initiation of God&rsquo;s plan for saving man, discussing man&rsquo;s relationship to God in the covenants that God established (chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.3.25.0.0.0.0.0">25</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. The Use of the Word </span><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Man</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> to Refer to the Human Race</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Before discussing the subject matter of this chapter, it is necessary to consider briefly whether it is appropriate to use the word <span style="font-style:italic;">man</span> to refer to the entire human race (as in the title for this chapter). Some people today object to ever using the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; to refer to the human race in general (including both men and women), because it is claimed that such usage is insensitive to women. Those who make this objection would prefer that we <span style="font-style:italic;">only</span> use &ldquo;gender neutral&rdquo; terms such as &ldquo;humanity,&rdquo; &ldquo;humankind,&rdquo; &ldquo;human beings,&rdquo; or &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to refer to the human race.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		After considering this suggestion, I decided to continue to use the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; (as well as several of these other terms) to refer to the human race in this book because such usage has divine warrant in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5">Genesis 5</a>, and because I think there is a theological issue at stake. In <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.1-2">Genesis 5:1&ndash;2</a> we read, &ldquo;When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them <span style="font-style:italic;">and named them Man</span> when they were created&rdquo; (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.27">Gen. 1:27</a>). The Hebrew term translated &ldquo;Man&rdquo; is <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">אָדָם</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK132">H132</a>, the same term used for the name of Adam, and the same term that is sometimes used of man in distinction from woman (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.22">Gen. 2:22</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.25">25</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.12">3:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ec7.28">Eccl. 7:28</a>). Therefore the practice of using the same term to refer (1) to male human beings and (2) to the human race generally is a practice that <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 440  </span>originated with God himself, and we should not find it objectionable or insensitive.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Someone might object that this is just an accidental feature of the Hebrew language, but this argument is not persuasive because <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.2">Genesis 5:2</a> specifically describes God&rsquo;s activity of choosing a name that would apply to the human race as a whole.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		I am <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> here arguing that we must always duplicate biblical patterns of speech, <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> that it is wrong to use gender-neutral terms sometimes to refer to the human race (as I just did in this sentence), but rather that God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">naming</span> activity reported in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.2">Genesis 5:2</a> indicates that the use of &ldquo;man&rdquo; to refer to the entire race is a good and very appropriate choice, and one that we should not avoid.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The theological issue is whether there is a suggestion of male leadership or headship in the family from the beginning of creation. The fact that God did not choose to call the human race &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; but &ldquo;man,&rdquo; probably has some significance for understanding God&rsquo;s original plan for men and women. Of course, this question of the name we use to refer to the race is not the only factor in that discussion, but it is one factor, and our use of language in this regard does have some significance in the discussion of male-female roles today.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Why Was Man Created?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. God Did Not Need to Create Man, Yet He Created Us for His Own Glory</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In the discussion of God&rsquo;s independence in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.11.0.0.0.0.0">11</a> (see pp. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?ref=Page.pp+160-163">160&ndash;63</a>), we noted several Scripture passages that teach that God does not need us or the rest of creation for anything, yet we and the rest of creation glorify him and bring him joy. Since there was perfect love and fellowship among members of the Trinity for all eternity (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.5">John 17:5</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.24">24</a>), God did not create us because he was lonely or because he needed fellowship with other persons&mdash;God did not need us for any reason.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, <span style="font-style:italic;">God created us for his own glory</span>. In our treatment of his independence we noted that God speaks of his sons and daughters from the ends of the earth as those &ldquo;whom I created <span style="font-style:italic;">for my glory</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.7">Isa. 43:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.11-12">Eph. 1:11&ndash;12</a>). Therefore, we are to &ldquo;do all to the glory of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.31">1 Cor. 10:31</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This fact guarantees that our lives are significant. When we first realize that God did not need to create us and does not need us for anything, we could conclude that our lives have no importance at all. But Scripture tells us that we were created to glorify God, indicating that we are important <span style="font-style:italic;">to God himself</span>. This is the final definition of genuine importance or significance to our lives: If we are truly <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 441  </span>important to God for all eternity, then what greater measure of importance or significance could we want?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. What Is Our Purpose in Life?</span> The fact that God created us for his own glory determines the correct answer to the question, &ldquo;What is our purpose in life?&rdquo; Our purpose must be to fulfill the reason that God created us: to glorify him. When we are speaking with respect to God himself, that is a good summary of our purpose. But when we think of our own interests, we make the happy discovery that we are to enjoy God and take delight in him and in our relationship to him. Jesus says, &ldquo;I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.10">John 10:10</a>). David tells God, &ldquo;In your presence there is <span style="font-style:italic;">fulness of joy</span> in your right hand are pleasures for evermore&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps16.11">Ps. 16:11</a>). He longs to dwell in the house of the Lord forever, &ldquo;to behold the beauty of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps27.4">Ps. 27:4</a>), and Asaph cries out,
	</p>

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Fullness of joy is found in knowing God and delighting in the excellence of his character. To be in his presence, to enjoy fellowship with him, is a greater blessing than anything that can be imagined.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore, the normal heart attitude of a Christian is rejoicing in the Lord and in the lessons of the life he gives us (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.2-3">Rom. 5:2&ndash;3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php4.4">Phil. 4:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th5.16-18">1 Thess. 5:16&ndash;18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.2">James 1:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.6">1 Peter 1:6</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.8">8</a>; et al.).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As we glorify God and enjoy him, Scripture tells us that he rejoices in us. We read, &ldquo;As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, <span style="font-style:italic;">so shall your God rejoice over you</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is62.5">Isa. 62:5</a>), and Zephaniah prophesies that the Lord &ldquo;will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Zep3.17-18">Zeph. 3:17&ndash;18</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This understanding of the doctrine of the creation of man has very practical results. When we realize that God created us to glorify him, and when we start to act in ways that fulfill that purpose, then we begin to experience an intensity of joy in the Lord that we have never before known. When we add to that the realization that God himself is rejoicing in our fellowship with him, our joy becomes <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 442  </span>&ldquo;inexpressible and filled with heavenly glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.8">1 Peter 1:8</a>, author&rsquo;s expanded paraphrase).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Someone might object that it is wrong for God to seek glory for himself in creating man. Certainly it is wrong for human beings to seek glory for themselves, as we see in the dramatic example of the death of Herod Agrippa I. When he proudly accepted the shout of the crowd, &ldquo;The voice of a god, and not of man!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.22">Acts 12:22</a>), &ldquo;immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and died&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.23">Acts 12:23</a>). Herod died because he robbed God of glory, glory that God deserved and he did not.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But when God takes glory to himself, from whom is he robbing glory? Is there anyone who deserves glory more than he does? Certainly not! He is the Creator, he made all things, and he <span style="font-style:italic;">deserves</span> all glory. He is <span style="font-style:italic;">worthy</span> of receiving glory. <span style="font-style:italic;">Man</span> may not seek glory for himself, but in this case what is wrong for man is right for God, because he is the Creator. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">right</span> not wrong, that he be glorified&mdash;in fact, if he did not receive glory from all creatures in the universe, that would be horribly wrong! The twenty-four elders around God&rsquo;s throne continually sing,

		Paul exclaims, &ldquo;For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory for ever. Amen&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.36">Rom. 11:36</a>). When we begin to appreciate the nature of God as the infinitely perfect Creator who deserves all praise, then our hearts will not rest until we give him glory with all of our &ldquo;heart … soul … mind, and … strength&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk12.30">Mark 12:30</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Meaning of &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Image of God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Out of all the creatures God made, only one creature, man, is said to be made &ldquo;in the image of God.&rdquo; What does that mean? We may use the following definition: <span style="font-style:italic;">The fact that man is in the image of God means that man is like God and represents God</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When God says, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.26">Gen. 1:26</a>), the meaning is that God plans to make a creature similar to himself. Both the Hebrew word for &ldquo;image&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">צֶלֶם</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK7512">H7512</a>) and the Hebrew word for &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">דְּמוּת</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK1952">H1952</a>) refer to something that is <span style="font-style:italic;">similar</span> but not identical to the thing it represents or is an &ldquo;image&rdquo; of. The word <span style="font-style:italic;">image</span> can also be used of something that <span style="font-style:italic;">represents</span> something else.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 443  </span>Theologians have spent much time attempting to specify one characteristic of man, or a very few, in which the image of God is primarily seen. Some have thought that the image of God consists in man&rsquo;s intellectual ability, others in his power to make moral decisions and willing choices. Others have thought that the image of God referred to man&rsquo;s original moral purity, or his creation as male and female (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.27">Gen. 1:27</a>), or his dominion over the earth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this discussion it would be best to focus attention primarily on the <span style="font-style:italic;">meanings</span> of the words &ldquo;image&rdquo; and &ldquo;likeness.&rdquo; As we have seen, these terms had quite clear meanings to the original readers. When we realize that the Hebrew words for &ldquo;image&rdquo; and &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; simply informed the original readers that man was <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> God, and would in many ways <span style="font-style:italic;">represent</span> God, much of the controversy over the meaning of &ldquo;image of God&rdquo; is seen to be a search for too narrow and too specific a meaning. When Scripture reports that God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.26">Gen. 1:26</a>), it simply would have meant to the original readers, &ldquo;Let us make man to be <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> us and to <span style="font-style:italic;">represent</span> us.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because &ldquo;image&rdquo; and &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; had these meanings, Scripture does not need to say something like,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that man is in the image of God means that man is like God in the following ways: intellectual ability, moral purity, spiritual nature, dominion over the earth, creativity, ability to make ethical choices, and immortality [or some similar statement].
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Such an explanation is unnecessary, not only because the terms had clear meanings, but also because no such list could do justice to the subject: the text only needs to affirm that man is <span style="font-style:italic;">like God</span> and the rest of Scripture fills in more details to explain this. In fact, as we read the rest of Scripture, we realize that a full understanding of man&rsquo;s likeness to God would require a full understanding of <span style="font-style:italic;">who God is</span> in his being and in his actions and a full understanding of <span style="font-style:italic;">who man is</span> and what he does. The more we know about God and man the more similarities we will recognize, and the more fully we will understand what Scripture means when it says that man is in the image of God. The expression refers to every way in which man is like God.
	</p>

		This understanding of what it means that man is created in the image of God is reinforced by the similarity between <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.26">Genesis 1:26</a>, where God declares his <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 444  </span>intention to create man in his image and likeness, and <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.3">Genesis 5:3</a>: &ldquo;When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own <span style="font-style:italic;">likeness</span> [<span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">דְּמוּת</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK1952">H1952</a>], after his <span style="font-style:italic;">image</span> [<span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">צֶלֶם</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK7512">H7512</a>], and named him Seth.&rdquo; Seth was not identical to Adam, but he was like him in many ways, as a son is like his father. The text simply means that Seth was like Adam. It does not specify any specific number of ways that Seth was like Adam, and it would be overly restrictive for us to assert that one or another characteristic determined the way in which Seth was in Adam&rsquo;s image and likeness. Was it his brown eyes? Or his curly hair? Perhaps it was his athletic prowess, or his serious disposition or even his quick temper? Of course, such speculation would be useless. It is evident that <span style="font-style:italic;">every</span> way in which Seth was like Adam would be a part of his likeness to Adam and thus part of his being &ldquo;in the image&rdquo; of Adam. Similarly, <span style="font-style:italic;">every</span> way in which man is like God is part of his being in the image and likeness of God.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Fall: God&rsquo;s Image Is Distorted but Not Lost</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> We might wonder whether man could still be thought to be <span style="font-style:italic;">like God</span> after he sinned. This question is answered quite early in Genesis where God gives Noah the authority to establish the death penalty for murder among human beings just after the flood: God says &ldquo;Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; <span style="font-style:italic;">for God made man in his own image</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge9.6">Gen. 9:6</a>). Even though men are sinful, there is still enough likeness to God remaining in them that to murder another person (to &ldquo;shed blood&rdquo; is an Old Testament expression for taking a human life) is to attack the part of creation that most resembles God, and it betrays an attempt or desire (if one were able) to attack God himself. Man is still in God&rsquo;s image. The New Testament gives confirmation to this when <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas3.9">James 3:9</a> says that men generally, not just believers, &ldquo;are made in the likeness of God.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, since man has sinned, he is certainly not as fully like God as he was before. His moral purity has been lost and his sinful character certainly does not reflect God&rsquo;s holiness. His intellect is corrupted by falsehood and misunderstanding; his speech no longer continually glorifies God; his relationships are often governed by selfishness rather than love, and so forth. Though man is still in the image of God, in every aspect of life <span style="font-style:italic;">some</span> parts of that image have been distorted or lost. In short, &ldquo;God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ec7.29">Eccl. 7:29</a>). After the fall, then, we are still in God&rsquo;s image&mdash;we are still like God and we still represent God&mdash;but the image of God in us is distorted; we are less fully like God than we were before the entrance of sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore it is important that we understand the full meaning of the image of God not simply from observation of human beings as they currently exist, but from the biblical indications of the nature of Adam and Eve when God created them and when all that God had made was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.31">Gen. 1:31</a>). The true nature of man in the image of God was also seen in the earthly life of Christ. The full measure of the excellence of our humanity will not be seen again in life on earth until Christ returns and we have obtained all the benefits of the salvation he earned for us.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 445  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Redemption in Christ: a Progressive Recovering of More of God&rsquo;s Image</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Nonetheless, it is encouraging to turn to the New Testament and see that our redemption in Christ means that we can, even in this life, progressively grow into more and more likeness to God. For example, Paul says that as Christians we have a new nature that is &ldquo;being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.10">Col. 3:10</a>). As we gain in true understanding of God, his Word, and his world, we begin to think more and more of the thoughts that God himself thinks. In this way we are &ldquo;renewed in knowledge&rdquo; and we become more like God in our thinking. This is a description of the ordinary course of the Christian life. So Paul also can say that we &ldquo;are being changed into his likeness [lit. &ldquo;image,&rdquo; Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">εἰκών</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1635">G1635</a>)] from one degree of glory to another&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co3.18">2 Cor. 3:18</a>). Throughout this life, as we grow in Christian maturity we grow in greater likeness to God. More particularly, we grow in likeness to Christ in our lives and in our character. In fact, the goal for which God has redeemed us is that we might be &ldquo;conformed to the image of his Son&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.29">Rom. 8:29</a>) and thus be exactly like Christ in our moral character.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. At Christ&rsquo;s Return: Complete Restoration of God&rsquo;s Image</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The amazing promise of the New Testament is that just as we have been like Adam (subject to death and sin), we shall also be like Christ (morally pure, never subject to death again): &ldquo;Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.49">1 Cor. 15:49</a>). The full measure of our creation in the image of God is not seen in the life of Adam who sinned, nor is it seen in our lives now, for we are imperfect. But the New Testament emphasizes that God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man in his image was completely realized in the person of Jesus Christ. He himself &ldquo;is the image of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co4.4">2 Cor. 4:4</a> NASB); &ldquo;He is the image of the invisible God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.15">Col. 1:15</a>). In Jesus we see human likeness to God as it was intended to be, and it should cause us to rejoice that God has predestined us &ldquo;to be <span style="font-style:italic;">conformed to the image of his son</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.29">Rom. 8:29</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.49">1 Cor. 15:49</a>): &ldquo;When he appears <span style="font-style:italic;">we shall be like him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.2">1 John 3:2</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Specific Aspects of Our Likeness to God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Though we have argued above that it would be difficult to define all the ways in which we are like God, we can nevertheless mention several aspects of our existence that show us to be more like God than all the rest of creation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Moral Aspects</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> (1) We are creatures who are morally accountable before God for our actions. Corresponding to that accountability, we have (2) an inner sense of right and wrong that sets us apart from animals (who have little if any innate sense of morality or justice but simply respond from fear of punishment or hope of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 446  </span>reward). When we act according to God&rsquo;s moral standards, our likeness to God is reflected in (3) behavior that is holy and righteous before him, but, by contrast, our <span style="font-style:italic;">un</span>likeness to God is reflected whenever we sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Spiritual Aspects</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> (4) We have not only physical bodies but also immaterial spirits, and we can therefore act in ways that are significant in the immaterial, spiritual realm of existence. This means that we have (5) a spiritual life that enables us to relate to God as persons, to pray and praise him, and to hear him speaking his words to us. No animal will ever spend an hour in intercessory prayer for the salvation of a relative or a friend! Connected with this spiritual life is the fact that we have (6) immortality; we will not cease to exist but will live forever.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. Mental Aspects</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> (7) We have an ability to reason and think logically and learn that sets us apart from the animal world. Animals sometimes exhibit remarkable behavior in solving mazes or working out problems in the physical world, but they certainly do not engage in abstract reasoning&mdash;there is no such thing as the &ldquo;history of canine philosophy,&rdquo; for example, nor have any animals since creation developed at all in their understanding of ethical problems or use of philosophical concepts, etc. No group of chimpanzees will ever sit around the table arguing about the doctrine of the Trinity or the relative merits of Calvinism or Arminianism! In fact, even in developing physical and technical skills we are far different from animals: beavers still build the same kind of dams they have built for a thousand generations, birds still build the same kind of nests, and bees still build the same kinds of hives. But we continue to develop greater skill and complexity in technology, in agriculture, in science, and in nearly every field of endeavor.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(8) Our use of complex, abstract language sets us far apart from the animals. I could tell my son, when he was four years old, to go and get the big, red screwdriver from my workbench in the basement. Even if he had never seen it before, he could easily perform the task because he knew meanings of &ldquo;go,&rdquo; &ldquo;get,&rdquo; &ldquo;big,&rdquo; &ldquo;red,&rdquo; &ldquo;screwdriver,&rdquo; &ldquo;workbench,&rdquo; and &ldquo;basement.&rdquo; He could have done the same for a small, brown hammer or a black bucket beside the workbench or any of dozens of other items that he perhaps had never seen before but could visualize when I described them in a few brief words. No chimpanzee in all history has been able to perform such a task&mdash;a task that has not been learned through repetition with reward, but is simply described in words that refer to an item that the hearer has never seen before. Yet four-year-old human beings can do this routinely, and we think nothing of it. Most eight-year-olds can write an understandable letter to their grandparents describing a trip to the zoo, or can move to a foreign country and learn any other language in the world, and we think it entirely normal. But no animal will ever write such a letter to its grandparents, or give the past, present, and future of even one French verb, or <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 447  </span>read a detective story and understand it, or understand the meaning of even one verse from the Bible. Human children do all these things quite readily, and in so doing they show themselves so far superior to the whole animal kingdom that we wonder why people have sometimes thought that we are merely another kind of animal.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(9) Another mental difference between humans and animals is that we have an awareness of the distant future, even an inward sense that we will live beyond the time of our physical death, a sense that gives many people a desire to attempt to be right with God before they die (God &ldquo;has put eternity into man&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ec3.11">Eccl. 3:11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(10) Our likeness to God is also seen in our human creativity in areas such as art, music, and literature, and in scientific and technological inventiveness. We should not think of such creativity as restricted to world-famous musicians or artists&mdash;it is also reflected in a delightful way in the play acting or skits put on by children, in the skill reflected in the cooking of a meal or the decorating of a home or the planting of a garden, and in the inventiveness shown by every human being who &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; something that just wasn&rsquo;t working correctly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The foregoing aspects of likeness to God have been ways in which we differ from animals <span style="font-style:italic;">absolutely</span> not merely in degree. But there are other areas where we differ from animals in significant degree, and these also can show our likeness to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(11) In the area of emotions, our likeness to God is seen in a large difference in degree and complexity of emotions. Of course, animals do show some emotions (anyone who has owned a dog can remember evident expressions of joy, sadness, fear of punishment when it has done wrong, anger if another animal invades its &ldquo;turf,&rdquo; contentment, and affection, for example). But in the complexity of emotions that we experience, once again we are far different than the rest of creation. After watching my son&rsquo;s baseball game, I can simultaneously feel sad that his team lost, happy that he played well, proud that he was a good sport, thankful to God for giving me a son and giving me the joy of watching him grow up, joyful because of the song of praise that has been echoing in my mind all afternoon, and anxious because we are going to be late for dinner! It is very doubtful that an animal experiences anything approaching this complexity of emotional feeling.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">d. Relational Aspects</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> In addition to our unique ability to relate to God (discussed above), there are other relational aspects of being in God&rsquo;s image. (12) Although animals no doubt have some sense of community with each other, the depth of interpersonal harmony experienced in human marriage, in a human family when it functions according to God&rsquo;s principles, and in a church when a community of believers is walking in fellowship with the Lord and with each other, is much greater than the interpersonal harmony experienced by any animals. In our family relationships and in the church, we are also superior to angels, who do not marry or bear children or live in the company of God&rsquo;s redeemed sons and daughters.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(13) In marriage itself we reflect the nature of God in the fact that as men and women we have equality in importance but difference in roles from the time that God created us (see discussion in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.3.22.0.0.0.0.0">22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 448  </span>(14) Man is like God also in his relationship to the rest of creation. Specifically, man has been given the right to rule over the creation and when Christ returns will even be given authority to sit in judgment over angels (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.3">1 Cor. 6:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.26">Gen. 1:26</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.28">28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps8.6-8">Ps. 8:6&ndash;8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">e. Physical Aspects</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Is there any sense in which our human bodies are also a part of what it means to be made in the image of God? Certainly we should not think that our physical bodies imply that God himself has a body, for &ldquo;God is spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.24">John 4:24</a>), and it is sin to think of him or to portray him in any way that would imply that he has a material or a physical body (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex20.4">Ex. 20:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115.3-8">Ps. 115:3&ndash;8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.23">Rom. 1:23</a>). But even though our physical bodies should in no way be taken to imply that God has a physical body, are there still some ways in which our bodies reflect something of God&rsquo;s own character and thereby constitute part of what it means to be created in the image of God? Certainly this is true in some respects. For example, our physical bodies give us the ability to see with our eyes. This is a Godlike quality because God himself sees, and sees far more than we will ever see, although he does not do it with physical eyes like we have. Our ears give us the ability to hear, and this is a Godlike ability, even though God does not have physical ears. Our mouths give us the ability to speak, reflecting the fact that God is a God who speaks. Our senses of taste and touch and smell give us the ability to understand and enjoy God&rsquo;s creation, reflecting the fact that God himself understands and enjoys his creation, though in a far greater sense than we do.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is important that we recognize that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">man himself</span> who is created in the image of God, not just his spirit or his mind. Certainly our physical bodies are a very important part of our existence and, as transformed when Christ returns, they will continue to be part of our existence for all eternity (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.43-45">1 Cor. 15:43&ndash;45</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.51-55">51&ndash;55</a>). Our bodies therefore have been created by God as suitable instruments to represent in a physical way our human nature, which has been made to be like God&rsquo;s own nature. In fact, almost everything we do is done by means of the use of our physical bodies&mdash;our thinking, our moral judgments, our prayer and praise, our demonstrations of love and concern for each other&mdash;all are done using the physical bodies God has given us. Therefore, if we are careful to point out that we are <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> saying that God has a physical body, we may say that (15) our physical bodies in various ways reflect something of God&rsquo;s own character as well. Moreover, much physical movement and demonstration of God-given skill comes about through the use of our body. And certainly (16) the God-given physical ability to bear and raise children who are like ourselves (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.3">Gen. 5:3</a>) is a reflection of God&rsquo;s own ability to create human beings who are like himself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Especially in the last several points, these differences between human beings and the rest of creation are not <span style="font-style:italic;">absolute differences</span> but often differences of very great degree. We mentioned that there is some kind of emotion experienced by animals. There is some experience of authority in relationships where animal communities have leaders whose authority is accepted by the others in the group. Moreover, there is <span style="font-style:italic;">some</span> similarity even in those differences we think more absolute: animals are able to reason to some extent and can communicate with each other in various ways that in some primitive sense can be called &ldquo;language.&rdquo; This should not be <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 449  </span>surprising: if God made the entire creation so that it reflects his character in various ways, this is what we would expect. In fact, the more complex and highly developed animals are <span style="font-style:italic;">more</span> like God than lower forms of animals. Therefore we should not say that <span style="font-style:italic;">only</span> man reflects any likeness to God at all, for in one way or another all of creation reflects some likeness to God. But it is still important to recognize that <span style="font-style:italic;">only man</span> out of all of creation, is so like God that he can be said to be &ldquo;in the image of God.&rdquo; This scriptural affirmation, together with the scriptural commands that we are to imitate God in our lives (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.1">Eph. 5:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.16">1 Peter 1:16</a>), and the observable facts that we can recognize in looking at ourselves and the rest of creation, all indicate that we are <span style="font-style:italic;">much more like God</span> than all the rest of creation. In some respects the differences are absolute, and in other respects they are relative, but they are all significant.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, our appreciation of the ways in which we are like God can be enhanced by the realization that, unlike the rest of God&rsquo;s creation, we have an ability to grow to become <span style="font-style:italic;">more like God</span> throughout our lives. Our moral sense can be more highly developed through study of Scripture and prayer. Our moral behavior can reflect more and more the holiness of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co7.1">2 Cor. 7:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.16">1 Peter 1:16</a>; et al.). Our spiritual life can be enriched and deepened. Our use of reason and language can become more accurate and truthful and more honoring to God. Our sense of the future can become intensified as we grow in our hope of living with God forever. Our future existence can be enriched as we lay up treasures in heaven and seek for increased heavenly reward (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.19-21">Matt. 6:19&ndash;21</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.10-15">1 Cor. 3:10&ndash;15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>). Our ability to rule over the creation can be extended by faithful use of the gifts God has given us; our faithfulness to the God-given purposes for our creation as men and women can be increased as we follow biblical principles in our families; our creativity can be employed in ways that are more and more pleasing to God; our emotions can be more and more conformed to the pattern of Scripture so that we become more like David, a man after God&rsquo;s own heart (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa13.14">1 Sam. 13:14</a>). Our interpersonal harmony in our families and in the church can reflect more and more the unity that exists among the persons in the Trinity. As we consciously seek to grow into greater likeness to God in all these areas, we also demonstrate an ability that itself sets us apart from the rest of creation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. Our Great Dignity as Bearers of God&rsquo;s Image</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> It would be good for us to reflect on our likeness to God more often. It will probably amaze us to realize that when the Creator of the universe wanted to create something &ldquo;in his image,&rdquo; something <span style="font-style:italic;">more like himself</span> than all the rest of creation, he made us. This realization will give us a profound sense of dignity and significance as we reflect on the excellence of all the rest of God&rsquo;s creation: the starry universe, the abundant earth, the world of plants and animals, and the angelic kingdoms are remarkable, even magnificent. But we are more like our Creator than any of these things. We are the culmination of God&rsquo;s infinitely wise and skillful work of creation. Even though sin has greatly marred that likeness, we nonetheless now reflect much of it and shall even more as we grow in likeness to Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet we must remember that even fallen, sinful man has the <span style="font-style:italic;">status</span> of being in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 450  </span>God&rsquo;s image (see discussion of <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge9.6">Gen. 9:6</a>, above). Every single human being, no matter how much the image of God is marred by sin, or illness, or weakness, or age, or any other disability, still has the <span style="font-style:italic;">status</span> of being in God&rsquo;s image and therefore must be treated with the dignity and respect that is due to God&rsquo;s image-bearer. This has profound implications for our conduct toward others. It means that people of every race deserve equal dignity and rights. It means that elderly people, those seriously ill, the mentally retarded, and children yet unborn, deserve full protection and honor as human beings. If we ever deny our unique status in creation as God&rsquo;s only image-bearers, we will soon begin to depreciate the value of human life, will tend to see humans as merely a higher form of animal, and will begin to treat others as such. We will also lose much of our sense of meaning in life.

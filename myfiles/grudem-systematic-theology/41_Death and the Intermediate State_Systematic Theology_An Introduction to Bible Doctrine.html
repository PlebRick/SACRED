		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Why Do Christians Die?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Our treatment of the application of redemption must include a consideration of death and the question of how Christians should view their own death and the death of others. We also must ask what happens to us between the time that we die and the time that Christ returns to give us new resurrection bodies.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Death Is Not a Punishment for Christians</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Paul tells us clearly that there is &ldquo;no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>). All the penalty for our sins has been paid. Therefore, even though we know that Christians die, we should not view the death of Christians as a punishment from God or in any way a result of a penalty due to us for our sins. It is true that the penalty for sin is death, but that penalty no longer applies to us&mdash;not in terms of physical death, and not in terms of spiritual death or separation from God. All of that has been paid for by Christ. Therefore there must be another reason than punishment for our sins if we are to understand why Christians die.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Death Is the Final Outcome of Living in a Fallen World</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In his great wisdom, God decided that he would not apply to us the benefits of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work all at once. Rather, he has chosen to apply the benefits of salvation to us gradually over time (as we have seen in chapters <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.5.33.0.0.0.0.0">33&ndash;40</a>). Similarly, he has not chosen to remove all evil from the world immediately, but to wait until the final judgment and the establishment of the new heaven and new earth (see chapters <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.7.56.0.0.0.0.0">56</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.7.57.0.0.0.0.0">57</a>). In short, we still live in a fallen world and our experience of salvation is still incomplete.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The last aspect of the fallen world to be removed will be death. Paul says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 811  </span>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <span style="font-style:italic;">The last enemy to be destroyed is death</span>. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.26">1 Cor. 15:26</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Christ returns,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		then shall come to pass the saying that is written:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		&ldquo;Death is swallowed up in victory.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		&ldquo;O death, where is your victory?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		O death, where is your sting?&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:18pt; text-align:right;" lang="en-US">
		(<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.54-55">1 Cor. 15:54&ndash;55</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But until that time death remains a reality even in the lives of Christians. Although death does not come to us as a penalty for our individual sins (for that has been paid by Christ), it does come to us as a result of living in a fallen world, where the effects of sin have not all been removed. Related to the experience of death are other results of the fall that harm our physical bodies and signal the presence of death in the world&mdash;Christians as well as non-Christians experience aging, illnesses, injuries, and natural disasters (such as floods, violent storms, and earthquakes). Although God often answers prayers to deliver Christians (and also non-Christians) from some of these effects of the fall for a time (and thereby indicates the nature of his coming kingdom), nevertheless, Christians eventually experience all of these things to some measure, and, until Christ returns, all of us will grow old and die. The &ldquo;last enemy&rdquo; has not yet been destroyed. And God has chosen to allow us to experience death before we gain all the benefits of salvation that have been earned for us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. God Uses the Experience of Death to Complete Our Sanctification</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Throughout our Christian lives we know that we never have to pay any penalty for sin, for that has all been taken by Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>). Therefore, when we do experience pain and suffering in this life, we should never think it is because God is <span style="font-style:italic;">punishing</span> us (for our harm). Sometimes suffering is simply a result of living in a sinful, fallen world, and sometimes it is because God is <span style="font-style:italic;">disciplining</span> us (for our good), but in all cases we are assured by <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.28">Romans 8:28</a> that &ldquo;God causes <span style="font-style:italic;">all things</span> to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose&rdquo; (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">nasb</span>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The positive purpose for God&rsquo;s discipline is clear in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12">Hebrews 12</a>, where we read:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Lord disciplines him whom he loves … He disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.6">Heb. 12:6</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.10-11">10&ndash;11</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Not all discipline is in order to correct us from sins that we have committed; it can also be allowed by God to strengthen us in order that we may gain greater ability to trust God and resist sin in the challenging path of obedience. We see this clearly in the life of Jesus, who, though he was without sin, yet &ldquo;learned obedience <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 812  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">through what he suffered</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb5.8">Heb. 5:8</a>). He was made perfect &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">through suffering</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.10">Heb. 2:10</a>). Therefore we should see all the hardship and suffering that comes to us in life as something that God brings to us <span style="font-style:italic;">to do us good</span> strengthening our trust in him and our obedience, and ultimately increasing our ability to glorify him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Consequently, we should view the aging and weakness and sometimes sickness leading up to death as another kind of discipline that God allows us to go through in order that through this process our sanctification might be furthered and ultimately completed when we go to be in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The challenge that Jesus gives to the church in Smyrna could really be given to every believer: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Be faithful unto death</span> and I will give you the crown of life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.10">Rev. 2:10</a>). Paul says his goal in life is that he may become like Christ: &ldquo;that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, <span style="font-style:italic;">becoming like him in his death</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.10">Phil. 3:10</a>). Paul thought about the way in which Jesus died, and made it his goal to exemplify the same characteristics in his life when it came time for him to die&mdash;that in whatever circumstances he found himself, he, like Christ, would continue obeying God, trusting God, forgiving others, and caring for the needs of those around him, thus in every way bringing glory to God even in his death. Therefore when in prison, without knowing whether he would die there or come out alive, he could still say, &ldquo;it is my eager expectation and hope that I shall not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always <span style="font-style:italic;">Christ will be honored</span> in my body, whether by life <span style="font-style:italic;">or by death</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.20">Phil. 1:20</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The understanding that death is not in any way a punishment for sin, but simply something God brings us through in order to make us more like Christ, should be a great encouragement to us. It should take away from us the fear of death that haunts the minds of unbelievers (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.15">Heb. 2:15</a>). Nevertheless, although God will bring good to us through the process of death, we must still remember that death is not natural; it is not right; and in a world created by God it is something that ought not to be. It is an enemy, something that Christ will finally destroy (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.26">1 Cor. 15:26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Our Experience of Death Completes Our Union With Christ</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Another reason why God allows us to experience death, rather than taking us immediately to heaven when we become Christians, is that through death we imitate Christ in what he did and thereby experience closer union with him. Paul can say that we are fellow heirs with Christ &ldquo;provided we <span style="font-style:italic;">suffer with him</span> in order that we may also be glorified with him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.17">Rom. 8:17</a>). And Peter tells his readers not to be surprised at the fiery testing that comes on them, but encourages them, &ldquo;rejoice in so far as <span style="font-style:italic;">you share Christ&rsquo;s sufferings</span> that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.13">1 Peter 4:13</a>). As we noted above, such union with Christ in suffering includes union with him in death as well (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.10">Phil. 3:10</a>). Jesus is the &ldquo;pioneer and perfecter of our faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.2">Heb. 12:2</a>), and we follow after him as we run the race of life. Peter writes, &ldquo;Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.21">1 Peter 2:21</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Our </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> to God Is More Important Than Preserving Our Own Lives</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> If God uses the experience of death to deepen our trust in him and to <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 813  </span>strengthen our obedience to him, then it is important that we remember that the world&rsquo;s goal of preserving one&rsquo;s own physical life at all costs is not the highest goal for a Christian: obedience to God and faithfulness to him in every circumstance is far more important. This is why Paul could say, &ldquo;I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac21.13">Acts 21:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac25.11">25:11</a>). He told the Ephesian elders, &ldquo;I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.24">Acts 20:24</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It was this conviction&mdash;that obedience to God is far more important than the preservation of life&mdash;that gave Paul courage to go back into the city of Lystra after he had just been stoned and left for dead (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.20">Acts 14:20</a>), and then return there again shortly thereafter (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.21-22">Acts 14:21&ndash;22</a>). He endured many sufferings and dangers (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.23-27">2 Cor. 11:23&ndash;27</a>), often risking his life, in order to obey Christ fully. Therefore he could say at the end of his life, with a note of great triumph, &ldquo;The time of my departure has come. <span style="font-style:italic;">I have fought the good fight</span> I have finished the race, I have kept the faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti4.6-7">2 Tim. 4:6&ndash;7</a>). This same conviction empowered Old Testament saints to accept martyrdom rather than sin: &ldquo;Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life&rdquo; (literally, &ldquo;that they might obtain a better resurrection,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11.35">Heb. 11:35</a>). This conviction also gave Peter and the other apostles courage, when facing the threat of death, to say, &ldquo;We must obey God rather than men&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.29">Acts 5:29</a>). Certainly this was the point of Jesus&rsquo; command to the church at Smyrna, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Be faithful unto death</span> and I will give you the crown of life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.10">Rev. 2:10</a>). We also read that there will be rejoicing in heaven when the faithful saints have conquered the devil &ldquo;by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for <span style="font-style:italic;">they loved not their lives even unto death</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.11">Rev. 12:11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The persuasion that we may honor the Lord even in our death, and that faithfulness to him is far more important than preserving our lives, has given courage and motivation to martyrs throughout the history of the church. When faced with a choice of preserving their own lives and sinning, or giving up their own lives and being faithful, they chose to give up their own lives&mdash;&ldquo;they loved not their lives even unto death&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.11">Rev. 12:11</a>). Even in times where there is little persecution and little likelihood of martyrdom, it would be good for us to fix this truth in our minds once for all, for if we are willing to give up even our lives for faithfulness to God, we shall find it much easier to give up everything else for the sake of Christ as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. How Should We Think of Our Own Death and the Death of Others?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Our Own Death</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The New Testament encourages us to view our own death not with fear but with joy at the prospect of going to be with Christ. Paul says, &ldquo;We would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.8">2 Cor. 5:8</a>). When he is in prison, not knowing whether he will be executed or released, he can say:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For to me to live is Christ, and <span style="font-style:italic;">to die is gain</span>. If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 814  </span>between the two. <span style="font-style:italic;">My desire is to depart and be with Christ</span> for that is far better. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.21-23">Phil. 1:21&ndash;23</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We also read John&rsquo;s word in Revelation, &ldquo;And I heard a voice from heaven saying, &lsquo;Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth.&rsquo; &lsquo;Blessed indeed,&rsquo; says the Spirit, &lsquo;that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re14.13">Rev. 14:13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Believers need have no fear of death, therefore, for Scripture reassures us that not even &ldquo;death&rdquo; will &ldquo;separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.38-39">Rom. 8:38&ndash;39</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps23.4">Ps. 23:4</a>). In fact, Jesus died in order that he might &ldquo;deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.15">Heb. 2:15</a>). This verse reminds us that a clear testimony to our lack of fear of death will provide a strong witness for Christians in an age that tries to avoid talking about death and has no answer for it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Death of Christian Friends and Relatives</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> While we can look forward to our own death with a joyful expectation of being in Christ&rsquo;s presence, our attitude will be somewhat different when we experience the death of Christian friends and relatives. In these cases we will experience genuine sorrow&mdash;but mixed with joy that they have gone to be with the Lord.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is not wrong to express real sorrow at the loss of fellowship with loved ones who have died, and sorrow also for the suffering and hardship that they may have gone through prior to death. Sometimes Christians think it shows lack of faith if they mourn deeply for a brother or sister Christian who has died. But Scripture does not support that view, because when Stephen was stoned, we read that &ldquo;Devout men buried Stephen, <span style="font-style:italic;">and made great lamentation over him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.2">Acts 8:2</a>). If there ever was certainty that someone went to be with the Lord, it occurred in the case of Stephen. As he died, he said, &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.56">Acts 7:56</a>). Then when he was dying, he prayed, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Lord, do not hold this sin against them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.59-60">Acts 7:59&ndash;60</a>). And this occurred in Jerusalem, with all the apostles still present, those apostles who had seen Jesus himself after he had been raised from the dead. There was no lack of faith on anyone&rsquo;s part that Stephen was in heaven experiencing great joy in the presence of the Lord. Yet in spite of this, &ldquo;Devout men buried Stephen, <span style="font-style:italic;">and made great lamentation over him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.2">Acts 8:2</a>). Their sorrow showed the genuine grief that they felt at the loss of fellowship with someone whom they loved, and it was not wrong to express this sorrow&mdash;it was right. Even Jesus, at the tomb of Lazarus, &ldquo;wept&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn11.35">John 11:35</a>), experiencing sorrow at the fact that Lazarus had died, that his sisters and others were experiencing such grief, and also, no doubt, at the fact that there was death in the world at all, for ultimately it is unnatural and ought not to be in a world created by God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Ephesian elders, whom Paul had taught personally for three years, later &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">wept</span> and embraced Paul and kissed him, sorrowing most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they should see his face no more&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.37-38">Acts 20:37&ndash;38</a>). <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 815  </span>And Paul himself, in the same letter in which he expressed such a desire to depart from this life and be with Christ, said that if Epaphroditus had died, he himself would have had &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">sorrow upon sorrow</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.27">Phil. 2:27</a>). Moreover, King David, the man after God&rsquo;s own heart, the man who in his psalms frequently spoke of living forever with God, nonetheless had great sorrow when he learned that Saul and Jonathan had died (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Sa1.11-27">2 Sam. 1:11&ndash;27</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, the sorrow that we feel is clearly mingled with hope and joy. Paul does not tell the Thessalonians that they should not grieve <span style="font-style:italic;">at all</span> concerning their loved ones who have died, but he writes, &ldquo;that you may not grieve <span style="font-style:italic;">as others do</span> who have no hope&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.13">1 Thess. 4:13</a>)&mdash;they should not grieve in the same way, with the same bitter despair, that unbelievers have. But certainly they should grieve. He assures them that Christ &ldquo;died for us so that whether we wake or sleep we might live with him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th5.10">1 Thess. 5:10</a>), and thereby encourages them that those who have died have gone to be with the Lord. That is why Scripture can say, &ldquo;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth … that they may rest from their labors&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re14.13">Rev. 14:13</a>). In fact, Scripture even tells us, &ldquo;Precious in the sight of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> is the death of his saints&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps116.15">Ps. 116:15</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore, though we have genuine sorrow when Christian friends and relatives die, we also can say with Scripture, &ldquo;O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?… Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.55-57">1 Cor. 15:55&ndash;57</a>). Though we mourn, our mourning should be mixed with worship of God and thanksgiving for the life of the loved one who has died. Worship is especially important at this time, as we see in the examples of David and of Job. When David&rsquo;s child died, he stopped praying for the child&rsquo;s health, and worshiped God: &ldquo;Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the Lord, <span style="font-style:italic;">and worshiped</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Sa12.20">2 Sam. 12:20</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. The Death of Unbelievers</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When unbelievers die, the sorrow we feel is not mingled with the joy of assurance that they have gone to be with the Lord forever. This sorrow, especially regarding those we have been close to, is very deep and real. Paul himself, when thinking about some of his Jewish brothers who had rejected Christ, said, &ldquo;I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit, that <span style="font-style:italic;">I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart</span>. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen by race&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.1-3">Rom. 9:1&ndash;3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet it also must be said that we often do not have absolute certainty that a person has persisted in refusal to trust in Christ all the way to the point of death. The knowledge of one&rsquo;s impending death often will bring about genuine heart searching on the part of the dying person, and sometimes words of Scripture or words of Christian testimony that have been heard long ago will be recalled and the person may come to genuine repentance and faith. Certainly, we do not have <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 816  </span>any assurance that this has happened unless there is explicit evidence for it, but it is also good to realize that in many cases we have only probable but not absolute knowledge that those whom we have known as unbelievers have persisted in their unbelief until the point of death. In some cases we simply do not know.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, after a non-Christian has died, it would be wrong to give any indication to others that we think that person has gone to heaven. This would simply be to give misleading information and false assurance, and to diminish the urgency of the need for those who are still alive to trust in Christ. It is much better, as we have opportunity, to focus on the fact that the sorrow that we feel at the loss of someone whom we love causes us to reflect on our own life and destiny as well. In fact, the times when we are able to talk as a friend to the loved ones of an unbeliever who has died are often times when the Lord will open up opportunities to talk about the gospel with those who are still living.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, it is often very helpful in such circumstances to speak with genuine thankfulness about the good qualities that we have noticed and been encouraged by in the life of the person who has died. A good example of that is seen in David&rsquo;s reaction when King Saul died. Even though Saul had become an evil king and had pursued David and tried to kill him many times, once Saul had died, David spoke freely and publicly about the good things Saul had done:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. What Happens When People Die?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Souls of Believers Go Immediately Into God&rsquo;s Presence</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Death is a temporary cessation of bodily life and a separation of the soul from the body. Once a believer has died, though his or her physical body remains on the earth and is buried, at the moment of death the soul (or spirit) of that believer goes immediately into the presence of God with rejoicing. When Paul thinks about death he says, &ldquo;We would rather be <span style="font-style:italic;">away from the body and at home with the Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.8">2 Cor. 5:8</a>). To be away from the body is to be at home with the Lord. He also says that his desire is &ldquo;to <span style="font-style:italic;">depart and be with Christ</span> for that is far better&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.23">Phil. 1:23</a>). And Jesus said to the thief who was dying on the cross next to him, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> you will be with me in Paradise&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.43">Luke 23:43</a>). The author of Hebrews says that when Christians come together to worship they come not only into the presence of God in heaven, but also into the presence of &ldquo;the spirits of just men made <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 817  </span>perfect&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.23">Heb. 12:23</a>). However, as we shall see in more detail in the next chapter, God will not leave our dead bodies in the earth forever, for when Christ returns the souls of believers will be reunited with their bodies, their bodies will be raised from the dead, and they will live with Christ eternally.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. The Bible Does Not Teach the Doctrine of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Purgatory</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The fact that the souls of believers go immediately into God&rsquo;s presence means that <span style="font-style:italic;">there is no such thing as purgatory</span>. In Roman Catholic teaching, purgatory is the place where the souls of believers go to be further purified from sin until they are ready to be admitted into heaven. According to this view, the sufferings of purgatory are given to God in substitute for the punishment for sins that believers should have received in time, but did not. Speaking of purgatory, Ott says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Suffrages operate in such a matter that the satisfactory value of the good works is offered to God in substitution for the temporal punishment for sins which the poor souls still have to render. It operates by way of remission of temporal punishments due to sins.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But this doctrine is not taught in Scripture, and it is in fact contrary to the verses quoted immediately above. The Roman Catholic Church has found support for this doctrine, not in the pages of canonical Scripture as we defined it in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.1.3.0.0.0.0.0">3</a> above, and as Protestants have accepted it since the Reformation, but in the writings of the Apocrypha, particularly in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Mac12.42-45">2 Maccabees 12:42&ndash;45</a>:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		[Judas Maccabeus, the leader of the Jewish forces] also took a collection, man by man, to the amount of 2,000 drachmas of silver, and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a sin offering. In doing this he acted very well and honorably, taking into account the resurrection. For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish <span style="font-style:italic;">to pray for the dead</span>. But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Therefore <span style="font-style:italic;">he made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their sin</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here it is clear that prayer for the dead is approved, and also making an offering to God to deliver the dead from their sin. But in response it must be said that this literature is not equal to Scripture in authority, and should not be taken as an authoritative source of doctrine. Moreover, it contradicts the clear statements about departing and being with Christ quoted above, and thereby opposes the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 818  </span>clear teaching of New Testament Scripture. Furthermore, when it talks about the offering of Judas making &ldquo;atonement [Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐξηιλασμός</span> (&ldquo;propitiation&rsquo;)] for the dead&rdquo; it contradicts the explicit teaching of the New Testament that Christ alone made atonement for us. Finally, this passage in 2 Maccabees is difficult to square even with Roman Catholic teaching, because it teaches that soldiers who had died in the mortal sin of idolatry (which cannot be forgiven, according to Catholic teaching) should have prayers and sacrifices offered for them with the possibility that they will be delivered from their suffering.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Roman Catholic theology finds support for the doctrine of purgatory primarily in the passage from 2 Maccabees quoted above, and in the teaching of the tradition of the church. Other passages cited by Ott in support of the doctrine of purgatory are <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.18">2 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.26">Matthew 5:26</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.15">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.32">Matthew 12:32</a>. In <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.18">2 Timothy 1:18</a>, Paul says, concerning Onesiphorus, &ldquo;When he arrived in Rome he searched for me eagerly and found me&mdash;may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day&mdash;and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.17-18">2 Tim. 1:17&ndash;18</a>). The claim of those who find support for the doctrine of purgatory is that &ldquo;Onesiphorus … apparently was no longer among the living at the time of the Second Epistle to Timothy.&rdquo; This seems to be based on the fact that Paul refers not to Onesiphorus himself but &ldquo;the household of Onesiphorus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.16">2 Tim. 1:16</a>); however, that phrase does not prove that Onesiphorus had died, but only that Paul was wishing blessings not only on him but on his entire household. This would not be unusual since Onesiphorus had served in Ephesus where Paul had worked for three years (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.18">2 Tim. 1:18</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti4.19">4:19</a>). To build support for purgatory on the idea that Onesiphorus had already died is simply to build it on an assumption that cannot be supported with clear evidence. (It is not unusual for Paul to express a wish that some Christians would be blessed in the Day of Judgment&mdash;see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th5.23">1 Thess. 5:23</a>.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.32">Matthew 12:32</a>, Jesus says, &ldquo;Whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.&rdquo; Ott says that this sentence &ldquo;leaves open the possibility that sins are forgiven not only in this world but in the world to come.&rdquo; However, this is simply an error in reasoning: to say that something will not happen in the age to come does not imply that it might happen in the age to come! What is needed to prove the doctrine of purgatory is not a negative statement such as this but a positive statement that says that people suffer for the purpose of continuing purification after they die. But Scripture nowhere says this.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.15">1 Corinthians 3:15</a> Paul says that on the Day of Judgment, the work that everyone has done will be judged and tested by fire, and then says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up</span> he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.&rdquo; But this does not speak of a <span style="font-style:italic;">person</span> being burned or suffering punishment, but simply of <span style="font-style:italic;">his work</span> as being tested by fire&mdash;that which is good will be like gold, silver, and precious stones that will last forever (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.12">12</a>). Moreover, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 819  </span>Ott himself admits that this is something that occurs not during this age but during the day of &ldquo;the general judgment,&rdquo; and this further indicates that it can hardly be used as a convincing argument for purgatory. Finally, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.26">Matthew 5:26</a>, after warning people to make friends quickly with their accusers while they are going to the court, lest the accuser hand them to the judge and the judge to the guard and they be put in prison, Jesus then says, &ldquo;You will never get out till you have paid the last penny.&rdquo; Ott understands this as a parable teaching a &ldquo;time-limited condition of punishment in the other world.&rdquo; But surely there is no indication in context that this is a parable&mdash;Jesus is giving practical teaching about reconciliation of human conflicts and the avoidance of situations that naturally lead to anger and personal injury (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.21-26">Matt. 5:21&ndash;26</a>). Other passages of Scripture that have sometimes been referred to in support of the doctrine of purgatory simply do not speak directly about this idea at all, and can all easily be understood in terms of punishment and deliverance from distress in this life, or of a life of eternal blessing with God in heaven in the life to come.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		An even more serious problem with this doctrine is that it teaches that we must add something to the redemptive work of Christ, and that his redemptive work for us was not enough to pay the penalty for all our sins. But this is certainly contrary to the teaching of Scripture. Moreover, in a pastoral sense, the doctrine of purgatory robs believers of the great comfort that should be theirs in knowing that those who have died have immediately gone into the presence of the Lord, and knowing that they also, when they die, will &ldquo;depart and be with Christ, for that is far better&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.23">Phil. 1:23</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. The Bible Does Not Teach the Doctrine of &ldquo;Soul Sleep&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The fact that souls of believers go immediately into God&rsquo;s presence also means that <span style="font-style:italic;">the doctrine of soul sleep is incorrect</span>. This doctrine teaches that when believers die they go into a state of unconscious existence, and the next thing that they are conscious of will be when Christ returns and raises them to eternal life. This doctrine has been taught occasionally by one person or another in the history of the church, including some Anabaptists at the Reformation, and some of the Irvingites in England in the nineteenth century. In fact, one of John Calvin&rsquo;s first writings was a tract against this doctrine, a doctrine that has never found wide acceptance in the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Support for the doctrine of soul sleep has generally been found in the fact that Scripture several times speaks of the state of death as &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; or &ldquo;falling asleep&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt9.24">Matt. 9:24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt27.52">27:52</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn11.11">John 11:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.60">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.36">13:36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.6">1 Cor. 15:6</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.18">18</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.20">20</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.51">51</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.13">1 Thess. 4:13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th5.10">5:10</a>). Moreover, certain passages seem to teach that the dead do not have a conscious existence (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps6.5">Ps. 6:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115.17">115:17</a> [but see v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115.18">18</a>!]; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ec9.10">Eccl. 9:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is38.19">Isa. 38:19</a>). But when Scripture represents death as &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; it is simply a metaphorical expression used to indicate that death is only temporary for Christians, just as sleep is temporary. This is clearly seen, for example, when Jesus tells his disciples about the death of Lazarus. He says, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 820  </span>go to awake him out of sleep&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn11.11">John 11:11</a>). We should notice that Jesus does not here say, &ldquo;The soul of Lazarus is sleeping,&rdquo; nor, in fact, does any passage in Scripture say that the soul of a person is sleeping or unconscious (a statement that would be necessary to prove the doctrine of soul sleep). Rather Jesus simply says that <span style="font-style:italic;">Lazarus</span> has fallen asleep. Then John explains, &ldquo;Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, &ldquo;Lazarus is dead&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn11.12-13">John 11:12&ndash;13</a>). The other passages that speak about people sleeping when they die are likewise to be interpreted as simply a metaphorical expression to teach that death is temporary.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As for the passages that indicate that the dead do not praise God, or that there is a ceasing of conscious activity when people die, these are all to be understood from the perspective of life in this world. From our perspective it appears that once people die, they do not engage in these activities any longer. But <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115">Psalm 115</a> presents the full biblical perspective on this viewpoint. It says, &ldquo;The dead do not praise the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, nor do any that go down into silence.&rdquo; But then it continues in the very next verse with a contrast indicating that those who believe in God will bless the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> forever: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">But we will bless the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> from this time forth and for evermore</span>. Praise the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115.17-18">Ps. 115:17&ndash;18</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, the passages quoted above demonstrating that the souls of believers go immediately into God&rsquo;s presence and enjoy fellowship with him there (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.8">2 Cor. 5:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.23">Phil. 1:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.43">Luke 23:43</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.23">Heb. 12:23</a>) all indicate that there is conscious existence and fellowship with God immediately after death for the believer. Jesus did not say, &ldquo;Today you will no longer have consciousness of anything that is going on,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Today <span style="font-style:italic;">you will be with me in Paradise</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.43">Luke 23:43</a>). Certainly the conception of paradise understood at that time was not one of unconscious existence but one of great blessing and joy in the presence of God. Paul did not say, &ldquo;My desire is to depart and be unconscious for a long period of time,&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;My desire is to depart <span style="font-style:italic;">and be with Christ</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.23">Phil. 1:23</a>)&mdash;and he certainly knew that Christ was not an unconscious, sleeping Savior, but one who was actively living and reigning in heaven. To be with Christ was to enjoy the blessing of fellowship in his presence, and that is why to depart and be with him was &ldquo;far better&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.23">Phil. 1:23</a>). That is why he says, &ldquo;We would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.8">2 Cor. 5:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.1">Hebrews 12:1</a> says, &ldquo;We are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,&rdquo; just after an entire chapter spent on the discussion of the faith of Old Testament saints who had died (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11">Heb. 11</a>), and the fact that the author encourages us to run the race of life with perseverance because we are surrounded by this great cloud of witnesses, both suggest that those who have died and gone before have some awareness of what is going on in the earth. Scripture says very little about this, probably because it does not want us to speak to those who have died or to pray to them or to contact them in any way (note Saul&rsquo;s great sin in this in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa28.7-25">1 Sam. 28:7&ndash;25</a>). Nonetheless, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.1-2">Hebrews 12:1&ndash;2</a> does give us this slight hint, probably as an encouragement to us to continue also to be faithful to God as were those who have died and gone to heaven before us. Similarly, at the end of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 821  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12">Hebrews 12</a>, the author tells us that when we worship we come into the presence of God in heaven, and we come not to &ldquo;the spirits of just men who are sleeping in an unconscious state&rdquo; but &ldquo;to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to a judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.22-24">Heb. 12:22&ndash;24</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.9-11">Revelation 6:9&ndash;11</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Re7.9-10">7:9&ndash;10</a> also clearly show the souls or spirits of those who have died and who have gone to heaven praying and worshiping, for they cry out with a loud voice, &ldquo;O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.10">Rev. 6:10</a>), and they are seen &ldquo;standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re7.9-10">Rev. 7:9&ndash;10</a>). All of these passages deny the doctrine of soul sleep, for they make it clear that the souls of believers experience conscious fellowship with God in heaven immediately upon death.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. Did Old Testament Believers Enter Immediately Into God&rsquo;s Presence?</span> Some have said that, although the souls of believers <span style="font-style:italic;">since Christ&rsquo;s resurrection</span> go immediately into God&rsquo;s presence in heaven, the souls of believers who died <span style="font-style:italic;">before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection</span> did not enjoy the blessings of heaven but went into a place of waiting for Christ&rsquo;s work of redemption to be complete. Sometimes this is called the <span style="font-style:italic;" lang="la">limbus patrum</span> or simply limbo. This view has been especially common in Roman Catholic theology, but it has also been held by some Lutherans. Some of the support for this doctrine comes from a particular view of the idea of Christ&rsquo;s descent into hell, which we discussed in an earlier chapter.

		Not many Scripture references talk about the state of Old Testament believers after they had died, but those that give us any indication of their state all point in the direction of immediate conscious enjoyment in the presence of God, not of a time of waiting away from God&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for <span style="font-style:italic;">God took him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.24">Gen. 5:24</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11.5">Heb. 11:5</a>). Elijah was not taken to a place on the border of hell, but he &ldquo;went up by a whirlwind <span style="font-style:italic;">into heaven</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki2.11">2 Kings 2:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt17.3">Matt. 17:3</a>, where Moses and Elijah appear, talking with Jesus). And David is confident that he will &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">dwell in the house of the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> for ever</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps23.6">Ps. 23:6</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps16.10-11">16:10&ndash;11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps17.15">17:15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115.18">115:18</a>). Moreover, when Jesus answers the Sadducees, he reminds them that God says, &ldquo;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rdquo; and then says, &ldquo;He is not God of the dead, but of the living&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt22.32">Matt. </a><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 822  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Mt22.32">22:32</a>), thus implying that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were living even at that very moment, and that God was their God. Moreover, in the story of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus does not say that Lazarus is unconscious, but reports Abraham as saying about Lazarus, &ldquo;Now he is comforted here&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.25">Luke 16:25</a>). Abraham himself is portrayed as dwelling consciously in a place that is very desirable&mdash;that the rich man longed to go to&mdash;certainly not a place on the fringe of hell. It is important to notice that since this is before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Lazarus was in the same situation as the Old Testament saints.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore it seems likely that Old Testament believers also entered immediately into heaven and enjoyed a time of fellowship with God upon their death. However, it may well have been true that additional rich blessings and much greater rejoicing came to them when Christ returned to heaven at his ascension. But this does not mean that they were transported to heaven for the first time, or that that was the first time they enjoyed the blessing of God&rsquo;s presence.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">d. Should We Pray for the Dead?</span> Finally, the fact that the souls of believers go immediately into God&rsquo;s presence means that <span style="font-style:italic;">we should not pray for the dead</span>. Although this idea is taught in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Mac12.42-45">2 Maccabees 12:42&ndash;45</a> (see above), it is nowhere taught in the Bible itself. Moreover, there is no indication that this was the practice of any Christians at the time of the New Testament, nor should it have been. Once <span style="font-style:italic;">believers</span> die they enter into God&rsquo;s presence and they are in a state of perfect happiness with him. What good would it do to pray for them anymore? Final heavenly reward will be based on deeds done in this life, as Scripture repeatedly testifies (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.12-15">1 Cor. 3:12&ndash;15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>; et al.). Further, the souls of <span style="font-style:italic;">unbelievers</span> who die go to a place of punishment and eternal separation from the presence of God. It would do no good to pray for them either, since their final destiny has been settled by their sin and their rebellion against God in this life. To pray for the dead therefore is simply to pray for something that God has told us has already been decided. Moreover, to teach that we should pray for the dead, or to encourage others to do so, would be to encourage false hope that the destinies of people might be changed after they die, something which Scripture nowhere encourages us to think. It may lead people to much useless anxiety and much time essentially wasted in prayers that will have absolutely no results, and will thereby divert attention from prayers that could be made for events for this life and could have great effect in advancing the work of the kingdom. We should spend time praying according to God&rsquo;s will.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Souls of Unbelievers Go Immediately to </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Eternal Punishment</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture never encourages us to think that people will have a second chance to trust in Christ after death. In fact, the situation is quite the contrary. Jesus&rsquo; story <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 823  </span>about the rich man and Lazarus gives no hope that people can cross from hell to heaven after they have died: though the rich man in hell called out, &ldquo;Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame,&rdquo; Abraham replied to him, &ldquo;Between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and <span style="font-style:italic;">none may cross from there to us</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.24-26">Luke 16:24&ndash;26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The book of Hebrews connects death with the consequence of judgment in close sequence: &ldquo;just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.27">Heb. 9:27</a>). Moreover, Scripture never represents the final judgment as depending on anything done after we die, but only on what has happened in this life (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">Matt. 25:31&ndash;46</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.5-10">Rom. 2:5&ndash;10</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>). Some have argued for a second chance to believe in the gospel on the basis of Christ&rsquo;s preaching to the spirits in prison in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.18-20">1 Peter 3:18&ndash;20</a> and the preaching of the gospel &ldquo;even to the dead&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.6">1 Peter 4:6</a>, but those are inadequate interpretations of the verses in question, and, on closer inspection, do not support such a view.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should also realize that the idea that there will be a second chance to accept Christ after death is based on the assumption that everyone deserves a chance to accept Christ and that eternal punishment only comes to those who consciously decide to reject him. But certainly that idea is not supported by Scripture: we all are sinners by nature and choice, and no one actually deserves any of God&rsquo;s grace or deserves any opportunity to hear the gospel of Christ&mdash;those come only because of God&rsquo;s unmerited favor. Condemnation comes not only because of a willful rejection of Christ, but also because of the sins that we have committed and the rebellion against God that those sins represent (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.18">John 3:18</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The idea that people have a second chance to accept Christ after death would also destroy most motivation for evangelism and missionary activity today, and is not consistent with the intense missionary zeal that was felt by the New Testament church as a whole, and that was especially exemplified in the missionary travels of the apostle Paul.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that there is conscious punishment for unbelievers after they die and that this punishment goes on forever is certainly a difficult doctrine for us to contemplate. But the passages teaching it appear so clear that it seems that we must affirm it if we are to affirm what Scripture teaches. Jesus says that at the day of final judgment he will say to those at his left hand, &ldquo;Depart from me, you cursed, into the <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal fire</span> prepared for the devil and his angels,&rdquo; and he says that &ldquo;they will go away into <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal punishment</span> but the righteous into eternal life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.41">Matt. 25:41</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.46">46</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These passages show that we cannot accept as faithful to Scripture the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic;">annihilationism</span>. This is a doctrine that says that unbelievers, either immediately upon death, or else after suffering for a period of time, will simply cease to exist&mdash;God will &ldquo;annihilate&rdquo; them and they will no longer be. Although the idea initially sounds attractive to us, and it avoids the emotional difficulty connected with affirming eternal conscious punishment for the wicked, such an idea is not <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 824  </span>explicitly affirmed in any passages of Scripture, and seems so clearly to be contradicted by those passages that connect the eternal blessing of the righteous with the eternal punishment of the wicked (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.46">Matt. 25:46</a>) and that talk about punishment extending to the wicked day and night forever (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re14.11">Rev. 14:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.10">20:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although unbelievers pass into a state of eternal punishment immediately upon death, their bodies will not be raised until the day of final judgment. On that day, their bodies will be raised and reunited with their souls, and they will stand before God&rsquo;s throne for final judgment to be pronounced upon them in the body (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">Matt. 25:31&ndash;46</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn5.28-29">John 5:28&ndash;29</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac24.15">Acts 24:15</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.12">Rev. 20:12</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.15">15</a>).

		 1. Have you thought very much about the possibility of your own death? Has there been an element of fear connected with those thoughts? What, if anything, do you fear about death? Do you think that these fears have come from the influence of the world around you or from Scripture? How would the teachings of Scripture encourage you to deal with these fears?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. Has this chapter changed your feelings about your own death in any way? Can you honestly contemplate it now as something that will bring you nearer to Christ and increase your own trust in God and faithfulness to him? How would you express your hopes regarding your own death?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Do you think you would have the courage to refuse to sin even if it meant being thrown to the lions in a Roman coliseum, or burned at the stake during the Reformation, or thrown in prison for years in some foreign country today? Do you think the Christian martyrs throughout history had thought that they would have enough courage when put to the test? What happened to them to equip them for this suffering (read <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.13">1 Cor. 10:13</a>)? If you can obtain a copy, you may wish to read the account of the martyrdom of Polycarp, a stirring testimony of faith in God and of God&rsquo;s faithfulness in the second century <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d</span>. Have you settled in your own mind that obedience to Christ is more important than preserving your own life? What would make you hesitant to believe this or act on this conviction?

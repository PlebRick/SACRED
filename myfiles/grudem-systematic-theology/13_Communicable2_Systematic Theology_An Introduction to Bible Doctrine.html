		<span style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the previous chapter we discussed the attributes of God that described his <span style="font-style:italic;">being</span> (spirituality, invisibility), his <span style="font-style:italic;">mental</span> attributes (knowledge, wisdom, and truthfulness), and his <span style="font-style:italic;">moral</span> attributes (goodness, love, mercy, grace, patience, holiness, peace, righteousness, jealousy, and wrath). In this chapter we will examine God&rsquo;s attributes of <span style="font-style:italic;">purpose</span> that is, attributes that have to do with making and carrying out decisions (will, freedom, and omnipotence) and his <span style="font-style:italic;">summary</span> attributes (perfection, blessedness, beauty, and glory).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. Attributes of Purpose</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this category of attributes we will discuss first God&rsquo;s will in general, then the freedom of God&rsquo;s will, and finally the omnipotence (or infinite power) of God&rsquo;s will.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">14. Will</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s will is that attribute of God whereby he approves and determines to bring about every action necessary for the existence and activity of himself and all creation</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This definition indicates that God&rsquo;s will has to do with deciding and approving the things that God is and does. It concerns God&rsquo;s choices of what to do and what not to do.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. God&rsquo;s Will in General</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Scripture frequently indicates God&rsquo;s will as the final or most ultimate reason for everything that happens. Paul refers to God as the one &ldquo;who accomplishes all things <span style="font-style:italic;">according to the counsel of his will</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.11">Eph. 1:11</a>). The phrase here translated &ldquo;all things&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">τὰ</span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el"> </span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">πάντα</span>) is used frequently by Paul to refer to everything that exists or everything in creation (see, for example, <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.10">Eph. 1:10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.23">23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.9">3:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.10">4:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.16">Col. 1:16</a> [twice], <a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.17">17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.36">Rom. 11:36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.6">1 Cor. 8:6</a> [twice]; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.27-28">15:27&ndash;28</a> [twice]). The word translated &ldquo;accomplishes&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐνεργέω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1919">G1919</a>, &ldquo;works, works out, brings about, produces&rdquo;) is a present participle and suggests continual activity. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 212  </span>phrase might more explicitly be translated, &ldquo;who continually brings about everything in the universe according to the counsel of his will.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		More specifically, all things were created by God&rsquo;s will: &ldquo;For you created all things, and <span style="font-style:italic;">by your will they existed and were created</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.11">Rev. 4:11</a>). Both Old and New Testaments speak of human government as coming about according to God&rsquo;s will: the voice from heaven tells Nebuchadnezzar that he is to learn &ldquo;that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da4.32">Dan. 4:32</a>), and Paul says that &ldquo;there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro13.1">Rom. 13:1</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		All the events connected with the death of Christ were according to God&rsquo;s will, the church at Jerusalem believed, for in their prayer they said, &ldquo;truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with all the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do <span style="font-style:italic;">whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.27-28">Acts 4:27&ndash;28</a>). The specific mention of the various parties involved at different stages of the crucifixion, together with the indefiniteness of the plural relative pronoun &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ὅσα</span>, from <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ὅσος</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4012">G4012</a>, &ldquo;the things which&rdquo;) implies that not simply the fact of Jesus&rsquo; death but all the detailed events connected with it are comprehended in this statement: God&rsquo;s hand and will had predestined that all those things would come about.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Sometimes it is God&rsquo;s will that Christians suffer, as is seen in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.17">1 Peter 3:17</a>, for example: &ldquo;For it is better to suffer for doing right, <span style="font-style:italic;">if that should be God&rsquo;s will</span> than for doing wrong.&rdquo; Then in the next chapter Peter says, &ldquo;Therefore let those who suffer <span style="font-style:italic;">according to God&rsquo;s will</span> do right and entrust their souls to a faithful Creator&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.19">1 Peter 4:19</a>). In this verse, the phrase &ldquo;according to God&rsquo;s will&rdquo; cannot refer to the manner in which Christians endure suffering, for then it would make the verse say essentially, &ldquo;Let those who suffer <span style="font-style:italic;">while doing right, do right</span> and entrust their souls …&rdquo; This would make the phrase &ldquo;according to God&rsquo;s will&rdquo; redundant. Rather, the phrase &ldquo;according to God&rsquo;s will&rdquo; must refer to the fact that these Christians are suffering, just as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will&rdquo; referred to suffering in the previous chapter (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.17">1 Peter 3:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		James encourages us to see all the events of our lives as subject to God&rsquo;s will. To those who say, &ldquo;Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and get gain,&rdquo; James says, &ldquo;You do not know about tomorrow … Instead you ought to say, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">if the Lord wills</span> we shall live and we shall do this or that&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas4.13-15">James 4:13&ndash;15</a>). To attribute so many events, even evil events, to the will of God often causes misunderstanding and difficulty for Christians. Some of the difficulties connected with this subject will be treated here and others will be dealt with in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.16.0.0.0.0.0">16</a> on God&rsquo;s providence.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Distinctions in Aspects of God&rsquo;s Will</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">: </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) Necessary will and free will</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Some distinctions made in the past may help us understand various aspects of God&rsquo;s will. Just as we can will or choose something eagerly or reluctantly, happily or with regret, secretly or publicly, so also God in the infinite greatness of his personality is able to will different things in different ways.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One helpful distinction applied to aspects of God&rsquo;s will is the distinction between God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">necessary will</span> and God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">free will</span>. God&rsquo;s necessary will includes <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 213  </span>everything that he must will according to his own nature. What does God will necessarily? He wills himself. God eternally wills to be, or wants to be, who he is and what he is. He says, &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex3.14">Ex. 3:14</a>). God <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> choose to be different than he is or to cease to exist.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">free will</span> includes all things that God decided to will but had no necessity to will according to his nature. Here we must put God&rsquo;s decision to create the universe, and all the decisions relating to the details of that creation. Here we must also place all God&rsquo;s acts of redemption. There was nothing in God&rsquo;s own nature that required him to decide to create the universe or to redeem out of sinful mankind a people for himself (see the discussion above concerning God&rsquo;s independence). However, God did decide to create and to redeem, and these were totally free choices on his part. Though within the members of the Trinity love and fellowship and glory exist in infinite measure for all eternity (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.5">John 17:5</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.24">24</a>), nonetheless God decided to create the universe and to redeem us for his own glory (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.7">Isa. 43:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is48.9-11">48:9&ndash;11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.36">Rom. 11:36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.6">1 Cor. 8:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.12">Eph. 1:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.11">Rev. 4:11</a>). It would be wrong for us ever to try to find a necessary cause for creation or redemption in the being of God himself, for that would rob God of his total independence. It would be to say that without us God could not truly be God. God&rsquo;s decisions to create and to redeem were totally free decisions.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(2) Secret will and revealed will:</span> Another helpful distinction applied to different aspects of God&rsquo;s will is the distinction between God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">secret will</span> and his <span style="font-style:italic;">revealed will</span>. Even in our own experience we know that we are able to will some things secretly and then only later make this will known to others. Sometimes we tell others before the thing that we have willed comes about, and at other times we do not reveal our secret will until the event we willed has happened.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Surely a distinction between aspects of God&rsquo;s will is evident in many passages of Scripture. According to Moses, &ldquo;The <span style="font-style:italic;">secret things</span> belong to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> our God; but the <span style="font-style:italic;">things that are revealed</span> belong to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt29.29">Deut. 29:29</a>). Those things that God has revealed are given for the purpose of obeying God&rsquo;s will: &ldquo;that we may <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> all the words of this law.&rdquo; There were many other aspects of his plan, however, that he had not revealed to them: many details about future events, specific details of hardship or of blessing in their lives, and so forth. With regard to these matters, they were simply to trust him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because God&rsquo;s revealed will usually contains his commands or &ldquo;precepts&rdquo; for our moral conduct, God&rsquo;s revealed will is sometimes also called God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">will of precept</span> or will of command. This revealed will of God is God&rsquo;s declared will concerning <span style="font-style:italic;">what we should do</span> or what God <span style="font-style:italic;">commands</span> us to do.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, God&rsquo;s secret will usually includes his hidden decrees by which he governs the universe and determines everything that will happen. He does not ordinarily reveal these decrees to us (except in prophecies of the future), so these decrees really are God&rsquo;s &ldquo;secret&rdquo; will. We find out what God has decreed when events actually happen. Because this secret will of God has to do with his decreeing of events in the world, this aspect of God&rsquo;s will is sometimes also called God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">will of decree</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 214  </span>There are several instances where Scripture mentions God&rsquo;s revealed will. In the Lord&rsquo;s prayer the petition, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Your will be done</span> On earth as it is in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.10">Matt. 6:10</a>) is a prayer that people would obey God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">revealed</span> will, his commands, on earth just as they do in heaven (that is, fully and completely). This could not be a prayer that God&rsquo;s secret will (that is, his decrees for events that he has planned) would in fact be fulfilled, for what God has decreed in his secret will shall certainly come to pass. To ask God to bring about what he has already decreed to happen would simply be to pray, &ldquo;May what is going to happen happen.&rdquo; That would be a hollow prayer indeed, for it would not be asking for anything at all. Furthermore, since we do not know God&rsquo;s secret will regarding the future, the person praying a prayer for God&rsquo;s secret will to be done would never know for what he or she was praying. It would be a prayer without understandable content and without effect. Rather, the prayer &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Your will</span> be done&rdquo; must be understood as an appeal for the <span style="font-style:italic;">revealed</span> will of God to be followed on earth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If the phrase is understood in this way, it provides a pattern for us to pray on the basis of God&rsquo;s commands in Scripture. In this sense, Jesus provides us with a guide for an exceedingly broad range of prayer requests. We are encouraged by Christ here to pray that people would obey God&rsquo;s laws, that they would follow his principles for life, that they would obey his commands to repent of sin and trust in Christ as Savior. To pray these things is to pray that God&rsquo;s will would be done on earth as it is in heaven.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A little later, Jesus says, &ldquo;Not every one who says to me, &ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> of my Father who is in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.21">Matt. 7:21</a>). Once again, the reference cannot be to God&rsquo;s secret will or will of decree (for all mankind follows this, even if unknowingly), but to God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">revealed</span> will, namely, the moral law of God that Christ&rsquo;s followers are to obey (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.50">Matt. 12:50</a>; probably also <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.14">18:14</a>). When Paul commands the Ephesians to &ldquo;understand <span style="font-style:italic;">what the will of the Lord is</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.17">Eph. 5:17</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.18">Rom. 2:18</a>), he again is speaking of God&rsquo;s revealed will. So also is John when he says, &ldquo;If we ask anything <span style="font-style:italic;">according to his will</span> he hears us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.14">1 John 5:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is probably best to put <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.4">1 Timothy 2:4</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.9">2 Peter 3:9</a> in this category as well. Paul says that God &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">desires</span> [or &ldquo;wills, wishes,&rsquo; Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">θέλω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2527">G2527</a>] all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.4">1 Tim. 2:4</a>). Peter says that the Lord &ldquo;is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.9">2 Peter 3:9</a>). In neither of these verses can God&rsquo;s will be understood to be his secret will, his decree concerning what will certainly occur. This is because the New Testament is clear that there will be a final judgment and not all will be saved. It is best therefore to understand these references as speaking of God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">revealed will</span> his commands for mankind to obey and his declaration to us of what is pleasing in his sight.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, many passages speak of God&rsquo;s secret will. When James tells us to say, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">If the Lord wills</span> we shall live and we shall do this or that&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas4.15">James 4:15</a>), he cannot be talking about God&rsquo;s revealed will or will of precept, for with regard to many of our actions we <span style="font-style:italic;">know</span> that it is according to God&rsquo;s command that we do one or another activity that we have planned. Rather, to trust in the secret will of God overcomes pride and expresses humble dependence on God&rsquo;s sovereign control over the events of our lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 215  </span>Another instance is found in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge50.20">Genesis 50:20</a>. Joseph says to his brothers, &ldquo;As for you, you meant evil against me; but <span style="font-style:italic;">God meant it for good</span> to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.&rdquo; Here God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">revealed</span> will to Joseph&rsquo;s brothers was that they should love him and not steal from him or sell him into slavery or make plans to murder him. But God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">secret</span> will was that in the disobedience of Joseph&rsquo;s brothers a greater good would be done when Joseph, having been sold into slavery into Egypt, gained authority over the land and was able to save his family.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Paul says to the Corinthians, &ldquo;I will come to you soon, <span style="font-style:italic;">if the Lord wills</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.19">1 Cor. 4:19</a>), he is not speaking of God&rsquo;s revealed will, for Paul has already determined, in obedience to God and in fulfillment of his apostolic office, to come to visit the Corinthians. He is speaking rather of God&rsquo;s secret will, his hidden plan for the future, which is unknown to Paul and which will be known only as it comes to pass (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac21.14">Acts 21:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.10">Rom. 1:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.32">15:32</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.11">Eph. 1:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.17">1 Peter 3:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.19">4:19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Both the revealing of the good news of the gospel to some and its hiding from others are said to be according to God&rsquo;s will. Jesus says, &ldquo;I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yea, Father, <span style="font-style:italic;">for such was your gracious will</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.25-26">Matt. 11:25&ndash;26</a>). This again must refer to God&rsquo;s secret will, for his revealed will is that all come to salvation. Indeed, only two verses later, Jesus commands everyone, &ldquo;Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.28">Matt. 11:28</a>). And both Paul and Peter tell us that God wills all people to be saved (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.4">1 Tim. 2:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.9">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Thus, the fact that some are not saved and some have the gospel hidden from them must be understood as happening according to God&rsquo;s secret will, unknown to us and inappropriate for us to seek to pry into. In the same way we must understand the mention of God&rsquo;s will in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.18">Romans 9:18</a> (&ldquo;He has mercy upon whomever he wills, and he hardens the heart of whomever he wills&rdquo;) and <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.28">Acts 4:28</a> (&ldquo;to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place&rdquo;) as references to God&rsquo;s secret will.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There is danger in speaking about evil events as happening according to the will of God, even though we see Scripture speaking of them in this way. One danger is that we might begin to think that God takes pleasure in evil, which he does not do (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Eze33.11">Ezek. 33:11</a>), though he can use it for his good purposes (see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.16.0.0.0.0.0">16</a> for further discussion). Another danger is that we might begin to blame God for sin, rather than ourselves, or to think that we are not responsible for our evil actions. Scripture, however, does not hesitate to couple statements of God&rsquo;s sovereign will with statements of man&rsquo;s responsibility for evil. Peter could say in the same sentence that Jesus was &ldquo;delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God,&rdquo; and also that &ldquo;this Jesus … <span style="font-style:italic;">you crucified and killed</span> by the hands of <span style="font-style:italic;">lawless men</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.23">Acts 2:23</a>). Both God&rsquo;s hidden will of decree and the culpable wickedness of &ldquo;lawless men&rdquo; in carrying it out are affirmed in the same statement. However we may understand the secret workings of God&rsquo;s hidden will, we must never understand it to imply that we are freed from responsibility for evil, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 216  </span>or that God is ever to be blamed for sin. Scripture never speaks that way, and we may not either, even though how this can be so may remain a mystery for us in this age.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">15. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Freedom</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s freedom is that attribute of God whereby he does whatever he pleases</span>. This definition implies that nothing in all creation can hinder God from doing his will. This attribute of God is therefore closely related to his will and his power. Yet this aspect of freedom focuses on the fact that God is not constrained by anything external to himself and that he is free to do whatever he wishes to do. There is no person or force that can ever dictate to God what he should do. He is under no authority or external restraint.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God&rsquo;s freedom is mentioned in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115">Psalm 115</a>, where his great power is contrasted with the weakness of idols: &ldquo;Our God is in the heavens; <span style="font-style:italic;">he does whatever he pleases</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115.3">Ps. 115:3</a>). Human rulers are not able to stand against God and effectively oppose his will, for &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>; he turns it wherever he will&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr21.1">Prov. 21:1</a>). Similarly, Nebuchadnezzar learns in his repentance that it is true to say of God, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">he does according to his will</span> in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da4.35">Dan. 4:35</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because God is free we should not try to seek any more ultimate answer for God&rsquo;s actions in creation than the fact that he willed to do something and that his will has perfect freedom (so long as the actions he takes are consistent with his own moral character). Sometimes people try to discover the reason why God had to do one or another action (such as create the world or save us). It is better simply to say that it was God&rsquo;s totally free will (working in a way consistent with his character) that was the final reason why he chose to create the world and to save sinners.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">16. Omnipotence (Power, Sovereignty)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s omnipotence means that God is able to do all his holy will</span>. The word <span style="font-style:italic;">omnipotence</span> is derived from two Latin words, <span style="font-style:italic;" lang="la">omni</span> &ldquo;all,&rdquo; and <span style="font-style:italic;" lang="la">potens</span> &ldquo;powerful,&rdquo; and means &ldquo;all-powerful.&rdquo; Whereas God&rsquo;s freedom referred to the fact that there are no external constraints on God&rsquo;s decisions, God&rsquo;s omnipotence has reference to his own power to do what he decides to do.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This power is frequently mentioned in Scripture. God is &ldquo;The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, strong and mighty, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, mighty in battle!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps24.8">Ps. 24:8</a>). The rhetorical question, &ldquo;Is anything too hard for the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge18.14">Gen. 18:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Je32.27">Jer. 32:27</a>) certainly implies (in the contexts in which it occurs) that nothing is too hard for the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>. In fact, Jeremiah says to God, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">nothing</span> is too hard for you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je32.17">Jer. 32:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul says that God is &ldquo;able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.20">Eph. 3:20</a>), and God is called the &ldquo;Almighty&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co6.18">2 Cor. 6:18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re1.8">Rev. 1:8</a>), a term (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">παντοκράτωρ</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4120">G4120</a>) that suggests the possession of all power and authority. Furthermore, the angel Gabriel says to Mary, &ldquo;With God nothing will be <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 217  </span>impossible&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.37">Luke 1:37</a>), and Jesus says, &ldquo;With God <span style="font-style:italic;">all things are possible</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt19.26">Matt. 19:26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These passages indicate that God&rsquo;s power is infinite, and that he is therefore not limited to doing only what he actually has done. In fact, God is able to do more than he actually does. For example, John the Baptist says in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt3.9">Matthew 3:9</a>, &ldquo;God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.&rdquo; God is one who &ldquo;does whatever he pleases&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps115.3">Ps. 115:3</a>); he could have destroyed Israel and raised up a great nation from Moses (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex32.10">Ex. 32:10</a>), but he did not do so.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, there are some things that God cannot do. God cannot will or do anything that would deny his own character. This is why the definition of omnipotence is stated in terms of God&rsquo;s ability to do &ldquo;all his holy will.&rdquo; It is not absolutely everything that God is able to do, but everything that is consistent with his character. For example, God cannot lie. In <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.2">Titus 1:2</a> he is called (literally) &ldquo;the unlying God&rdquo; or the &ldquo;God who never lies.&rdquo; The author of Hebrews says that in God&rsquo;s oath and promise &ldquo;it is impossible for God to lie&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.18">Heb. 6:18</a>, author&rsquo;s translation). <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti2.13">2 Timothy 2:13</a> says of Christ, &ldquo;He cannot deny himself.&rdquo; Furthermore, James says, &ldquo;God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.13">James 1:13</a>). Thus, God cannot lie, sin, deny himself, or be tempted with evil. He cannot cease to exist, or cease to be God, or act in a way inconsistent with any of his attributes.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This means that it is not entirely accurate to say that God can do anything. Even the Scripture passages quoted above that use phrases similar to this must be understood in their contexts to mean that God can do anything he wills to do or anything that is consistent with his character. Although God&rsquo;s power is infinite, his use of that power is qualified by his other attributes (just as all God&rsquo;s attributes qualify all his actions). This is therefore another instance where misunderstanding would result if one attribute were isolated from the rest of God&rsquo;s character and emphasized in a disproportionate way.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God&rsquo;s exercise of power over his creation is also called God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">sovereignty</span>. God&rsquo;s sovereignty is his exercise of rule (as &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; or &ldquo;king&rdquo;) over his creation. This subject will be discussed in more detail in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.16.0.0.0.0.0">16</a>, on God&rsquo;s providence.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As we conclude our treatment of God&rsquo;s attributes of purpose, it is appropriate to realize that he has made us in such a way that we show in our lives some faint reflection of each of them. God has made us as creatures with a <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span>. We exercise choice and make real decisions regarding the events of our lives. Although our will is not absolutely free in the way God&rsquo;s is, God has nonetheless given us <span style="font-style:italic;">relative freedom</span> within our spheres of activity in the universe he has created.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, we have an intuitive sense that it is our ability to exercise our wills and make choices, and to do so in a relatively free way, that is one of the most significant marks of God-likeness in our existence. Of course our desire to exercise our wills and our desire to be free from restraint can show themselves in sinful ways. People can become proud and can desire a kind of freedom that involves rebellion against God&rsquo;s authority and a refusal to obey his will. Nonetheless, when we use our will and our freedom to make choices that are pleasing to God, we reflect his character and bring glory to him. When human beings are deprived of their ability to make free choices by evil governments or by other circumstances, a significant part of their God-likeness is suppressed. It is not surprising that they will pay almost any price to regain their freedom. American revolutionary Patrick <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 218  </span>Henry&rsquo;s cry, &ldquo;Give me liberty or give me death!&rdquo; finds an echo deep within every soul created in the image of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We do not of course have infinite power or omnipotence any more than we have infinite freedom or any of God&rsquo;s other attributes to an infinite degree. But even though we do not have omnipotence, God has given us <span style="font-style:italic;">power</span> to bring about results, both physical power and other kinds of power: mental power, spiritual power, persuasive power, and power in various kinds of authority structures (family, church, civil government, and so forth). In all of these areas, the use of power in ways pleasing to God and consistent with his will is again something that brings him glory as it reflects his own character.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">E. &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; Attributes</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">17. Perfection</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s perfection means that God completely possesses all excellent qualities and lacks no part of any qualities that would be desirable for him</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is difficult to decide whether this should be listed as a separate attribute or simply be included in the description of the other attributes. Some passages say that God is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete.&rdquo; Jesus tells us, &ldquo;You, therefore, must be perfect, <span style="font-style:italic;">as your heavenly Father is perfect</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.48">Matt. 5:48</a>). And David says of God, &ldquo;His way is <span style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps18.30">Ps. 18:30</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt32.4">Deut. 32:4</a>). There is some scriptural precedent, therefore, for stating explicitly that God lacks nothing in his excellence: he fully possesses all of his attributes and lacks nothing from any one of those attributes. Furthermore, there is no quality of excellence that it would be desirable for God to have that he does not have: he is &ldquo;complete&rdquo; or &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; in every way.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This attribute is the first of those classified as a &ldquo;summary&rdquo; attribute because it does not fit well into the other categories that have been listed. Even though all the attributes of God modify all the others in some senses, those that fit in this category seem more directly to apply to all the attributes or to describe some aspect of all of the attributes that it is worthwhile to state explicitly.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">18. Blessedness</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> To be &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; is to be happy in a very full and rich sense. Often Scripture talks about the blessedness of those people who walk in God&rsquo;s ways. Yet in 1 Timothy Paul calls God &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">blessed</span> and only Sovereign&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti6.15">1 Tim. 6:15</a>) and speaks of &ldquo;the glorious gospel of the <span style="font-style:italic;">blessed</span> God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti1.11">1 Tim. 1:11</a>). In both instances the word is not <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">εὐλογητός</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2329">G2329</a> (which is often translated &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;), but <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μακάριος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3421">G3421</a>, which means &ldquo;happy&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, God&rsquo;s blessedness may be defined as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s blessedness means that God delights fully in himself and in all that reflects his character</span>. In this definition the idea of God&rsquo;s happiness or blessedness is connected directly to his own person as the focus of all that is worthy of joy or delight. This definition indicates that God is perfectly happy, that he has fullness of joy in himself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The definition reflects the fact that God takes pleasure in everything in creation that mirrors his own excellence. When he finished his work of creation, he looked at everything that he had made and saw that it was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.31">Gen. 1:31</a>). This indicates God&rsquo;s delight in and approval of his creation. Then in Isaiah we read a promise of God&rsquo;s future rejoicing over his people: &ldquo;As the bridegroom rejoices <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 219  </span>over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is62.5">Isa. 62:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr8.30-31">Prov. 8:30&ndash;31</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Zep3.17">Zeph. 3:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It may at first seem strange or even somewhat disappointing to us that when God rejoices in his creation, or even when he rejoices in us, it is really the reflection of his own excellent qualities in which he is rejoicing. But when we remember that the sum of everything that is desirable or excellent is found in infinite measure in God himself, then we realize that it could not be otherwise: <span style="font-style:italic;">whatever</span> excellence there is in the universe, <span style="font-style:italic;">whatever</span> is desirable, must ultimately have come from him, for he is the Creator of all and he is the source of all good. &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Every</span> good endowment and <span style="font-style:italic;">every</span> perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.17">James 1:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We ought therefore to say to ourselves, as Paul says to the Corinthians, &ldquo;What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.7">1 Cor. 4:7</a>). &ldquo;For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory for ever&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.36">Rom. 11:36</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We imitate God&rsquo;s blessedness when we find delight and happiness in all that is pleasing to God, both those aspects of our own lives that are pleasing to God and the deeds of others. In fact, when we are thankful for and delight in the specific abilities, preferences, and other characteristics with which God has created us as individuals, then we also imitate his attribute of blessedness. Furthermore, we imitate God&rsquo;s blessedness by rejoicing in the creation as it reflects various aspects of his excellent character. And we find our greatest blessedness, our greatest happiness, in delighting in the source of all good qualities, God himself.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">19. Beauty</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s beauty is that attribute of God whereby he is the sum of all desirable qualities</span>. This attribute of God has been implicit in a number of the preceding attributes, and is especially related to God&rsquo;s perfection. However, God&rsquo;s perfection was defined in such a way as to show that he does not <span style="font-style:italic;">lack</span> anything that would be desirable for him. This attribute, beauty, is defined in a positive way to show that God actually does possess all desirable qualities: &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; means that God doesn&rsquo;t lack anything desirable; &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; means that God has everything desirable. They are two different ways of affirming the same truth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, there is value in affirming this positive aspect of God&rsquo;s possession of everything that is desirable. It reminds us that all of our good and righteous desires, all of the desires that really ought to be in us or in any other creature, find their ultimate fulfillment in God and in no one else.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		David speaks of the beauty of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps27.4">Psalm 27:4</a>: &ldquo;One thing have I asked of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> all the days of my life, to behold <span style="font-style:italic;">the beauty of the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> and to inquire in his temple.&rdquo; A similar idea is expressed in another psalm: &ldquo;Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire besides you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps73.25">Ps. 73:25</a>). In both cases, the psalmist recognizes that his desire for God, who is the sum of everything desirable, far surpasses all other desires. This desire culminates in a longing to be near God and to enjoy his presence forevermore. Thus, the greatest blessing of the heavenly city shall be this: &ldquo;They shall see his face&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.4">Rev. 22:4</a>).

		We reflect God&rsquo;s beauty in our own lives when we exhibit conduct that is pleasing to him. Thus, Peter tells wives in the churches to which he writes that their &ldquo;adorning&rdquo; (that is, their source of beauty) should be &ldquo;the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God&rsquo;s sight is very precious&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.4">1 Peter 3:4</a>). Similarly, Paul instructs servants that by their conduct they should &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">adorn</span> the doctrine of God our Savior&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt2.10">Titus 2:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The beauty of our lives is so important to Christ that his purpose now is to sanctify the entire church &ldquo;that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.27">Eph. 5:27</a>). Thus, we individually and corporately reflect God&rsquo;s beauty in every way in which we exhibit his character. When we reflect his character, he delights in us and finds us beautiful in his sight.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But we also delight in God&rsquo;s excellence as we see it manifested in the lives of our brothers and sisters in the Lord. Therefore it is right that we feel joy and delight in the fellowship of one another, and that this joy deepens as our conformity to the life of Christ increases. It is right that we long to be in the fellowship of God&rsquo;s people in which God&rsquo;s character is manifested, for when we delight in the godliness of God&rsquo;s people, we are ultimately delighting in God himself as we see his character evidenced in the lives of his people.

Glory</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In one sense of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">glory</span> it simply means &ldquo;honor&rdquo; or &ldquo;excellent reputation.&rdquo; This is the meaning of the term in <a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.7">Isaiah 43:7</a>, where God speaks of his children, &ldquo;whom I created for my <span style="font-style:italic;">glory,</span>&rdquo; or <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.23">Romans 3:23</a>, which says that all &ldquo;have sinned and fall short of the <span style="font-style:italic;">glory</span> of God.&rdquo; It also has that meaning in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.5">John 17:5</a>, where Jesus speaks to the Father of &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">glory</span> which I had with you before the world was made,&rdquo; and in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.3">Hebrews 1:3</a>, which says that the Son &ldquo;is the radiance of God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">glory</span>&rdquo; (author&rsquo;s translation). In this sense, the glory of God is not exactly an attribute of his being but rather describes the superlative honor that should be given to God by everything in the universe (including, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.3">Heb. 1:3</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.5">John 17:5</a>, the honor that is shared among the members of the Trinity). But that is not the sense of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">glory</span> that we are concerned with in this section.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In another sense, God&rsquo;s &ldquo;glory&rdquo; means the bright light that surrounds God&rsquo;s presence. Since God is spirit, and not energy or matter, this visible light is not part of God&rsquo;s being but is something that was created. We may define it as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s glory is the created brightness that surrounds God&rsquo;s revelation of himself</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This &ldquo;attribute&rdquo; of God is really not an attribute of God in the sense that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 221  </span>others were, for here we are speaking not of God&rsquo;s own character but of the <span style="font-style:italic;">created</span> light or brilliance that surrounds God as he manifests himself in his creation. Thus, God&rsquo;s glory in this sense is not actually an attribute of God in himself. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s glory is something that belongs to him alone and is the appropriate outward expression of his own excellence. It seems right therefore to treat it here immediately after the attributes of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture often speaks of God&rsquo;s glory. David asks, &ldquo;Who is this King of glory? The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> of hosts, <span style="font-style:italic;">he is the King of glory!</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps24.10">Ps. 24:10</a>). We read in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps104.1-2">Psalm 104:1&ndash;2</a>, &ldquo;O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> my God, you are very great! You are clothed with honor and majesty, you who cover yourself with light as with a garment …&rdquo; This glory of God is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is mentioned again in the New Testament in connection with the annunciation of Jesus&rsquo; birth to the shepherds: &ldquo;And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and <span style="font-style:italic;">the glory of the Lord shone around them</span> and they were filled with fear&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk2.9">Luke 2:9</a>). God&rsquo;s glory was also evident at the transfiguration of Christ (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt17.2">Matt. 17:2</a>), and we find in the heavenly city yet to come that &ldquo;the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for <span style="font-style:italic;">the glory of God is its light</span> and its lamp is the Lamb&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.23">Rev. 21:23</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is very appropriate that God&rsquo;s revelation of himself should be accompanied by such splendor and brightness, for this glory of God is the visible manifestation of the excellence of God&rsquo;s character. The greatness of God&rsquo;s being, the perfection of all his attributes, is something that we can never fully comprehend, but before which we can only stand in awe and worship. Thus, it is appropriate indeed that the visible manifestation of God be such that we would be unable to gaze fully upon it, and that it would be so bright that it would call forth both great delight and deep awe from us when we behold it only in part.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Quite amazingly, God made us to reflect his glory. Paul tells us that even now in our Christian lives we all are being &ldquo;changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co3.18">2 Cor. 3:18</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.16">Matt. 5:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.15">Phil. 2:15</a>). Though we do not now find ourselves surrounded by a visible light, there is a brightness, a splendor, or a beauty about the manner of life of a person who deeply loves God, and it is often evident to those around such a person. In the life to come, such brightness will be intensified, so that as we reign with Christ, it seems that we also will receive an outward appearance that is appropriate to that reign and to our status as image bearers of God and servants of the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr4.18">Prov. 4:18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Da12.3">Dan. 12:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt13.43">Matt. 13:43</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.43">1 Cor. 15:43</a>).

Will we then continually feel this same fear the shepherds felt? Why or why not? Would you like to live in the presence of this glory? Can we experience any of it in this life?

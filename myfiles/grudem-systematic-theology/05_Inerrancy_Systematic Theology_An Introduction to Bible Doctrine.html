		Most books on systematic theology have not included a separate chapter on the inerrancy of the Bible. The subject has usually been dealt with under the heading of the authority of Scripture, and no further treatment has been considered necessary. However, this issue of inerrancy is of such concern in the evangelical world today that it warrants a separate chapter following our treatment of the authority of the Word of God.

		A. The Meaning of Inerrancy
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		We will not at this point repeat the arguments concerning the authority of Scripture that were given in chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.1.4.0.0.0.0.0">4</a>. There it was argued that all the words in the Bible are God&rsquo;s words, and that therefore to disbelieve or disobey any word in Scripture is to disbelieve or disobey God. It was argued further that the Bible clearly teaches that God cannot lie or speak falsely (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Sa7.28">2 Sam. 7:28</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Tt1.2">Titus 1:2</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Heb6.18">Heb. 6:18</a>). Therefore, all the words in Scripture are claimed to be completely true and without error in any part (<a href="logosref:Bible.Nu23.19">Num. 23:19</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps12.6">Pss. 12:6</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119.89">119:89</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119.96">96</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Pr30.5">Prov. 30:5</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt24.35">Matt. 24:35</a>). God&rsquo;s words are, in fact, the ultimate standard of truth (<a href="logosref:Bible.Jn17.17">John 17:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Especially relevant at this point are those Scripture texts that indicate the total truthfulness and reliability of God&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The words of the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> are words that are pure</span> silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps12.6">Ps. 12:6</a>, author&rsquo;s transl.), indicates the absolute reliability and purity of Scripture. Similarly, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Every word of God proves true</span>; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Pr30.5">Prov. 30:5</a>), indicates the truthfulness of every word that God has spoken. Though error and at least partial falsehood may characterize the speech of every human being, it is the characteristic of God&rsquo;s speech even when spoken through sinful human beings that it is never false and that it never affirms error: &ldquo;God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should repent&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Nu23.19">Num. 23:19</a>) was spoken by sinful Balaam specifically about the prophetic words that God had spoken through his own lips.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		With evidence such as this we are now in a position to define biblical inerrancy: <span style="font-style:italic;">The inerrancy of Scripture means that Scripture in the original manuscripts does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 91  </span>This definition focuses on the question of truthfulness and falsehood in the language of Scripture. The definition in simple terms just means that <span style="font-style:italic;">the Bible always tells the truth</span> and that it always tells the truth <span style="font-style:italic;">concerning everything it talks about</span>. This definition does not mean that the Bible tells us every fact there is to know about any one subject, but it affirms that what it does say about any subject is <span style="font-style:italic;">true</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		It is important to realize at the outset of this discussion that the focus of this controversy is on the question of truthfulness in speech. It must be recognized that absolute truthfulness in speech is consistent with some other types of statements, such as the following:

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Bible Can Be Inerrant and Still Speak in the Ordinary Language of Everyday Speech.</span> This is especially true in &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; or &ldquo;historical&rdquo; descriptions of facts or events. The Bible can speak of the sun rising and the rain falling because from the perspective of the speaker this is exactly what happens. From the standpoint of an observer standing on the sun (were that possible) or on some hypothetical &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; point in space, the earth rotates and brings the sun into view, and rain does not fall downward but upward or sideways or whatever direction necessary for it to be drawn by gravity toward the surface of the earth. But such explanations are hopelessly pedantic and would make ordinary communication impossible. From the standpoint of the speaker, the sun <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> rise and the rain <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> fall, and these are perfectly true descriptions of the natural phenomena the speaker observes.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		A similar consideration applies to numbers when used in measuring or in counting. A reporter can say that 8,000 men were killed in a certain battle without thereby implying that he has counted everyone and that there are not 7,999 or 8,001 dead soldiers. If roughly 8,000 died, it would of course be false to say that 16,000 died, but it would not be false in most contexts for a reporter to say that 8,000 men died when in fact 7,823 or 8,242 had died: the limits of truthfulness would depend on the degree of precision implied by the speaker and expected by his original hearers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This is also true for measurements. Whether I say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t live far from my office,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I live a little over a mile from my office,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I live one mile from my office,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I live 1.287 miles from my office,&rdquo; all four statements are still approximations to some degree of accuracy. Further degrees of accuracy might be obtained with more precise scientific instruments, but these would still be approximations to a certain degree of accuracy. Thus, measurements also, in order to be true, should conform to the degree of precision implied by the speaker and expected by the hearers in the original context. It should not trouble us, then, to affirm both that the Bible is absolutely truthful in everything it says and that it uses ordinary language to describe natural phenomena or to give approximations or round numbers when those are appropriate in the context.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		We should also note that language can make vague or imprecise statements without being untrue. &ldquo;I live a little over a mile from my office&rdquo; is a vague and imprecise statement, but it is also inerrant: there is nothing untrue about it. It does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact. In a similar way, biblical <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 92  </span>statements can be imprecise and still be totally true. Inerrancy has to do with <span style="font-style:italic;">truthfulness</span> not with the degree of precision with which events are reported.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Bible Can Be Inerrant and Still Include Loose or Free Quotations.</span> The method by which one person quotes the words of another person is a procedure that in large part varies from culture to culture. In contemporary American and British culture we are used to quoting a person&rsquo;s exact words when we enclose the statement in quotation marks (this is called direct quotation). But when we use indirect quotation (with no quotation marks) we only expect an accurate report of the substance of a statement. Consider this sentence: &ldquo;Elliot said that he would return home for supper right away.&rdquo; The sentence does not quote Elliot directly, but it is an acceptable and truthful report of Elliot&rsquo;s actual statement to his father, &ldquo;I will come to the house to eat in two minutes,&rdquo; even though the indirect quotation included none of the speaker&rsquo;s original words.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Written Greek at the time of the New Testament had no quotation marks or equivalent kinds of punctuation, and an accurate citation of another person needed to include only a correct representation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">content</span> of what the person said (rather like our indirect quotations): it was not expected to cite each word exactly. Thus, inerrancy is consistent with loose or free quotations of the Old Testament or of the words of Jesus, for example, so long as the <span style="font-style:italic;">content</span> is not false to what was originally stated. The original writer did not ordinarily imply that he was using the exact words of the speaker and only those, nor did the original hearers expect verbatim quotation in such reporting.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. It Is Consistent With Inerrancy to Have Unusual or Uncommon Grammatical Constructions in the Bible.</span> Some of the language of Scripture is elegant and stylistically excellent. Other scriptural writings contain the rough-hewn language of ordinary people. At times this includes a failure to follow the commonly accepted &ldquo;rules&rdquo; of grammatical expression (such as the use of a plural verb where grammatical rules would require a singular verb, or the use of a feminine adjective where a masculine one would be expected, or different spelling for a word than the one commonly used, etc.). These stylistically or grammatically irregular statements (which are especially found in the book of Revelation) should not trouble us, for they do not affect the truthfulness of the statements under consideration: a statement can be ungrammatical but still be entirely true. For example, an uneducated backwoodsman in some rural area may be the most trusted man in the county even though his grammar is poor, because he has earned a reputation for never telling a lie. Similarly, there are a few statements in Scripture (in the original languages) that are ungrammatical (according to current standards of proper grammar at that time) but still inerrant because they are completely true. The issue is <span style="font-style:italic;">truthfulness</span> in speech.

		B. Some Current Challenges to Inerrancy
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In this section we examine the major objections that are commonly made against the concept of inerrancy.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Bible Is Only Authoritative for &ldquo;Faith and Practice.&rdquo;</span> One of the most frequent objections is raised by those who say that the purpose of Scripture is to teach us in areas that concern &ldquo;faith and practice&rdquo; only; that is, in areas that directly relate to our religious faith or to our ethical conduct. This position would allow for the possibility of false statements in Scripture, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> areas such as in minor historical details or scientific facts&mdash;these areas, it is said, do not concern the purpose of the Bible, which is to instruct us in what we should believe and how we are to live.<sup>1</sup>
		
			
		 Its advocates often prefer to say that the Bible is &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">infallible</span>&rdquo; but they hesitate to use the word <span style="font-style:italic;">inerrant</span>.<sup>2</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The response to this objection can be stated as follows: the Bible repeatedly affirms that all of Scripture is profitable for us (<a href="logosref:Bible.2Ti3.16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>) and that <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> of it is &ldquo;God-breathed.&rdquo; Thus it is completely pure (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps12.6">Ps. 12:6</a>), perfect (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119.96">Ps. 119:96</a>), and true (<a href="logosref:Bible.Pr30.5">Prov. 30:5</a>). The Bible itself does not make any restriction on the kinds of subjects to which it speaks truthfully.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament contains further affirmations of the reliability of all parts of Scripture: in <a href="logosref:Bible.Ac24.14">Acts 24:14</a>, Paul says that he worships God, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">believing everything</span> laid down by the law or written in the prophets.&rdquo; In <a href="logosref:Bible.Lk24.25">Luke 24:25</a>, Jesus says that the disciples are &ldquo;foolish men&rdquo; because they are &ldquo;slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.&rdquo; In <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro15.4">Romans 15:4</a>, Paul says that &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">whatever</span> was written&rdquo; in the Old Testament was &ldquo;written for our instruction.&rdquo; These texts give no indication that there is any part of Scripture that is not to be trusted or relied on completely. Similarly, in <a href="logosref:Bible.1Co10.11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, Paul can refer even to minor historical details in the Old Testament (sitting down to eat and drink, rising up to dance) and can say both that they &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">happened</span>&rdquo; (thus implying historical reliability) and &ldquo;were written down for our instruction.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		If we begin to examine the way in which the New Testament authors trust the smallest historical details of the Old Testament narrative, we see no intention to separate out matters of &ldquo;faith and practice,&rdquo; or to say that this is somehow a recognizable category of affirmations, or to imply that statements not in that category need not be trusted or thought to be inerrant. Rather, it seems that the New Testament authors are willing to cite and affirm as true <span style="font-style:italic;">every detail</span> of the Old Testament.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In the following list are some examples of these historical details cited by New Testament authors. If all of these are matters of &ldquo;faith and practice,&rdquo; then <span style="font-style:italic;">every</span> historical detail of the Old Testament is a matter of &ldquo;faith and practice,&rdquo; and this objection ceases to be an objection to inerrancy. On the other hand, if so many details can be affirmed, then it seems that all of the historical details in the Old Testament can be affirmed as true, and we should not speak of restricting the necessary truthfulness of Scripture to some category of &ldquo;faith and practice&rdquo; that would exclude certain minor details. There are no types of details left that could not be affirmed as true.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This list indicates that the New Testament writers were willing to rely on the truthfulness of any part of the historical narratives of the Old Testament. No detail was too insignificant to be used for the instruction of New Testament Christians. There is no indication that they thought of a certain category of scriptural statements that were unreliable and untrustworthy (such as &ldquo;historical and scientific&rdquo; statements as opposed to doctrinal and moral passages). It seems clear that the Bible itself does not support any restriction on the kinds of subjects to which it speaks with absolute authority and truth; indeed, many passages in Scripture actually exclude the validity of this kind of restriction.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		A second response to those who limit the necessary truthfulness of Scripture to matters of &ldquo;faith and practice&rdquo; is to note that this position mistakes the <span style="font-style:italic;">major</span> purpose of Scripture for the <span style="font-style:italic;">total</span> purpose of Scripture. To say that the major purpose of Scripture is to teach us in matters of &ldquo;faith and practice&rdquo; is to make a useful and correct summary of God&rsquo;s purpose in giving us the Bible. But as a <span style="font-style:italic;">summary</span> it includes only the most prominent purpose of God in giving us Scripture. It is not, however, legitimate to use this summary to deny that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">part</span> of the purpose of Scripture to tell us about minor historical details or about some aspects of astronomy or geography, and so forth. A summary cannot properly be <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 95  </span>used to deny one of the things it is summarizing! To use it this way would simply show that the summary is not detailed enough to specify the items in question.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		It is better to say that the <span style="font-style:italic;">whole purpose</span> of Scripture is to say everything it does say, on whatever subject. Every one of God&rsquo;s words in Scripture was deemed by him to be important for us. Thus, God issues severe warnings to anyone who would take away even one word from what he has said to us (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt4.2">Deut. 4:2</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Dt12.32">12:32</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Re22.18-19">Rev. 22:18&ndash;19</a>): we cannot add to God&rsquo;s words or take from them, for all are part of his larger purpose in speaking to us. Everything stated in Scripture is there because God intended it to be there: God does not say anything unintentionally! Thus, this first objection to inerrancy makes a wrong use of a summary and thereby incorrectly attempts to impose artificial limits on the kinds of things about which God can speak to us.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Term </span><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Inerrancy</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Is a Poor Term.</span> People who make this second objection say that the term <span style="font-style:italic;">inerrancy</span> is too precise and that in ordinary usage it denotes a kind of absolute scientific precision that we do not want to claim for Scripture. Furthermore, those who make this objection note that the term <span style="font-style:italic;">inerrancy</span> is not used in the Bible itself. Therefore, it is probably an inappropriate term for us to insist upon.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The response to this objection may be stated as follows: first, the scholars who have used the term <span style="font-style:italic;">inerrancy</span> have defined it clearly for over a hundred years, and they have always allowed for the &ldquo;limitations&rdquo; that attach to speech in ordinary language. In no case has the term been used to denote a kind of absolute scientific precision by any responsible representative of the inerrancy position. Therefore those who raise this objection to the term are not giving careful enough attention to the way in which it has been used in theological discussions for more than a century.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Second, it must be noted that we often use nonbiblical terms to summarize a biblical teaching. The word <span style="font-style:italic;">Trinity</span> does not occur in Scripture, nor does the word <span style="font-style:italic;">incarnation</span>. Yet both of these terms are very helpful because they allow us to summarize in one word a true biblical concept, and they are therefore helpful in enabling us to discuss a biblical teaching more easily.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		It should also be noted that no other single word has been proposed which says as clearly what we want to affirm when we wish to talk about total truthfulness in language. The word <span style="font-style:italic;">inerrancy</span> does this quite well, and there seems no reason not to continue to use it for that purpose.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, in the church today we seem to be unable to carry on the discussion around this topic without the use of this term. People may object to this term if they wish, but, like it or not, this is the term about which the discussion has focused and almost certainly will continue to focus in the next several decades. When the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy (ICBI) in 1977 began a ten-year campaign to promote and defend the idea of biblical inerrancy, it became inevitable that this word would be the one about which discussion would proceed. The &ldquo;Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy,&rdquo; which was drafted and published in 1978 under ICBI sponsorship (see appendix <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.8.57.2.0.0.0.0">1</a>), defined what most evangelicals mean by inerrancy, perhaps not perfectly, but quite well, and further objections to <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 96  </span>such a widely used and well-defined term seem to be unnecessary and unhelpful for the church.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. We Have No Inerrant Manuscripts; Therefore, Talk About an Inerrant Bible Is Misleading.</span> Those who make this objection point to the fact that inerrancy has always been claimed for the first or <span style="font-style:italic;">original copies of the biblical documents</span>.<sup>4</sup>
		
			
		 Yet none of these survive: we have only copies of copies of what Moses or Paul or Peter wrote. What is the use, then, of placing so great importance on a doctrine that applies only to manuscripts that no one has?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In reply to this objection, it may first be stated that for over 99 percent of the words of the Bible, we <span style="font-style:italic;">know</span> what the original manuscript said. Even for many of the verses where there are textual variants (that is, different words in different ancient copies of the same verse), the correct decision is often quite clear, and there are really very few places where the textual variant is both difficult to evaluate and significant in determining the meaning. In the small percentage of cases where there is significant uncertainty about what the original text said, the general sense of the sentence is usually quite clear from the context. (One does not have to be a Hebrew or Greek scholar to know where these variants are, because all modern English translations indicate them in marginal notes with words such as &ldquo;some ancient manuscripts read …&rdquo; or &ldquo;other ancient authorities add …&rdquo;)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This is not to say that the study of textual variants is unimportant, but it is to say that the study of textual variants has not left us in confusion about what the original manuscripts said.<sup>5</sup>
		
			
		 It has rather brought us extremely close to the content of those original manuscripts. For most practical purposes, then, the <span style="font-style:italic;">current published scholarly texts</span> of the Hebrew Old Testament and Greek New Testament <span style="font-style:italic;">are the same as the original manuscripts</span>. Thus, when we say that the original manuscripts were inerrant, we are also implying that over 99 percent of the words in our present manuscripts are also inerrant, for they are exact copies of the originals. Furthermore, we <span style="font-style:italic;">know</span> where the uncertain readings are (for where there are no textual variants we have no reason to expect faulty copying of the original).<sup>6</sup>
		
			
		 Thus, our present manuscripts are for most purposes the same as the original manuscripts, and the doctrine of inerrancy therefore directly concerns our present manuscripts as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Furthermore, it is extremely important to affirm the inerrancy of the original documents, for the subsequent copies were made by men with no claim or guarantee by God that these copies would be perfect. But the original manuscripts <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 97  </span>are those to which the claims to be God&rsquo;s very words apply. Thus, if we have mistakes in the copies (as we do), then these are only the <span style="font-style:italic;">mistakes of men</span>. But if we have mistakes in the <span style="font-style:italic;">original manuscripts</span> then we are forced to say not only that men made mistakes, but that <span style="font-style:italic;">God himself</span> made a mistake and spoke falsely. This we cannot do.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. The Biblical Writers &ldquo;Accommodated&rdquo; Their Messages in Minor Details to the False Ideas Current in Their Day, and Affirmed or Taught Those Ideas in an Incidental Way.</span> This objection to inerrancy is slightly different from the one that would restrict the inerrancy of Scripture to matters of faith and practice, but it is related to it. Those who hold this position argue that it would have been very difficult for the biblical writers to communicate with the people of their time if they had tried to correct all the false historical and scientific information believed by their contemporaries. Those who hold this position would not argue that the points where the Bible affirms false information are numerous, or even that these places are the main points of any particular section of Scripture. Rather, they would say that when the biblical writers were attempting to make a larger point, they sometimes incidentally affirmed some falsehood believed by the people of their time.<sup>7</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		To this objection to inerrancy it can be replied, first, that God is Lord of human language who can use human language to communicate perfectly without having to affirm any false ideas that may have been held by people during the time of the writing of Scripture. This objection to inerrancy essentially denies God&rsquo;s effective lordship over human language.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Second, we must respond that such &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; by God to our misunderstandings would imply that God had acted contrary to his character as an &ldquo;unlying God&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Nu23.19">Num. 23:19</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Tt1.2">Titus 1:2</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Heb6.18">Heb. 6:18</a>). It is not helpful to divert attention from this difficulty by repeated emphasis on the gracious condescension of God to speak on our level. Yes, God does condescend to speak our language, the language of human beings. But no passage of Scripture teaches that he &ldquo;condescends&rdquo; so as to act contrary to his moral character. He is never said to be able to condescend so as to affirm&mdash;even incidentally&mdash;something that is false. If God were to &ldquo;accommodate&rdquo; himself in this way, he would cease to be the &ldquo;unlying God.&rdquo; He would cease to be the God the Bible represents him to be. Such activity would not in any way show God&rsquo;s greatness, for God does not manifest his greatness by acting in a way that contradicts his character. This objection thus at root misunderstands the purity and unity of God as they affect all of his words and deeds.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Furthermore, such a process of accommodation, if it actually had occurred, would create a serious moral problem for us. We are to be imitators of God&rsquo;s moral character (<a href="logosref:Bible.Le11.44">Lev. 11:44</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Lk6.36">Luke 6:36</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Eph5.1">Eph. 5:1</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Pe5.1">1 Peter 5:1</a>, et al.). Paul says, since in our new natures we are becoming more like God (<a href="logosref:Bible.Eph4.24">Eph. 4:24</a>), we should &ldquo;put away falsehood&rdquo; and &ldquo;speak the truth&rdquo; with one another (v. <a href="logosref:Bible.Eph4.25">25</a>). We are to imitate God&rsquo;s truthfulness in our speech. However, if the accommodation theory is correct, then God <span style="font-style:italic;">intentionally</span> made incidental affirmations of falsehood in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 98  </span>order to enhance communication. Therefore, would it not also be right for us intentionally to make incidental affirmations of falsehood whenever it would enhance communication? Yet this would be tantamount to saying that a minor falsehood told for a good purpose (a &ldquo;white lie&rdquo;) is not wrong. Such a position, contradicted by the Scripture passages cited above concerning God&rsquo;s total truthfulness in speech, cannot be held to be valid.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:9pt; margin:0pt;" lang="en-US">
	
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Inerrancy Overemphasizes the Divine Aspect of Scripture and Neglects the Human Aspect.</span> This more general objection is made by those who claim that people who advocate inerrancy so emphasize the divine aspect of Scripture that they downplay its human aspect.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		It is agreed that Scripture has both a human and a divine aspect, and that we must give adequate attention to both. However, those who make this objection almost invariably go on to insist that the truly &ldquo;human&rdquo; aspects of Scripture <span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> include the presence of some errors in Scripture. We can respond that though the Bible is fully human in that it was written by human beings using their own language, the activity of God in overseeing the writing of Scripture and causing it to be also his words means that it is different from much other human writing in precisely this aspect: it does not include error. That is exactly the point made even by sinful, greedy, disobedient Balaam in <a href="logosref:Bible.Nu23.19">Numbers 23:19</a>: God&rsquo;s speech through sinful human beings is different from the ordinary speech of men because &ldquo;God is not man that he should lie.&rdquo; Moreover, it is simply not true that all human speech and writing contains error, for we make dozens of statements each day that are completely true. For example: &ldquo;My name is Wayne Grudem.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have three children.&rdquo; &ldquo;I ate breakfast this morning.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:9pt; margin:0pt;" lang="en-US">
	
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. There Are Some Clear Errors in the Bible.</span> This final objection, that there are clear errors in the Bible, is either stated or implied by most of those who deny inerrancy, and for many of them the conviction that there are some actual errors in Scripture is a major factor in persuading them to challenge the doctrine of inerrancy.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In every case, the first answer that should be made to this objection is to ask where such errors are. In which specific verse or verses do these errors occur? It is surprising how frequently one finds that this objection is made by people who have little or no idea where the specific errors are, but who believe there are errors because others have told them so.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In other cases, however, people will mention one or more specific passages where, they claim, there is a false statement in Scripture. In these cases, it is important that we look at the biblical text itself, and look at it very closely. If we believe that the Bible is indeed inerrant, we should be eager and certainly not afraid to inspect these texts in minute detail. In fact, our expectation will be that close inspection will show there to be no error at all. Once again it is surprising how often it turns out that a careful reading just of the English text of the passage in question will bring to light one or more possible solutions to the difficulty.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In a few passages, no solution to the difficulty may be immediately apparent from reading the English text. At that point it is helpful to consult some commentaries on the text. Both Augustine (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 354&ndash;430) and John Calvin <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 99  </span>(1509&ndash;64), along with many more recent commentators, have taken time to deal with most of the alleged &ldquo;problem texts&rdquo; and to suggest plausible solutions to them. Furthermore some writers have made collections of all the most difficult texts and have provided suggested answers for them.<sup>8</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		There are a few texts where a knowledge of Hebrew or Greek may be necessary to find a solution, and those who do not have firsthand access to these languages may have to find answers either from a more technical commentary or by asking someone who does have this training. Of course, our understanding of Scripture is never perfect, and this means that there may be cases where we will be unable to find a solution to a difficult passage at the present time. This may be because the linguistic, historical, or contextual evidence we need to understand the passage correctly is presently unknown to us. This should not trouble us in a small number of passages so long as the overall pattern of our investigation of these passages has shown that there is, in fact, no error where one has been alleged.<sup>9</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		But while we must allow the <span style="font-style:italic;">possibility</span> of being unable to solve a particular problem, it should also be stated that there are many evangelical Bible scholars today who will say that they do not presently know of any problem texts for which there is no satisfactory solution. It is possible, of course, that some such texts could be called to their attention in the future, but during the past fifteen years or so of controversy over biblical inerrancy, no such &ldquo;unsolved&rdquo; text has been brought to their attention.<sup>10</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, a historical perspective on this question is helpful. There are no really &ldquo;new&rdquo; problems in Scripture. The Bible in its entirety is over 1,900 years old, and the alleged &ldquo;problem texts&rdquo; have been there all along. Yet throughout the history of the church there has been a firm belief in the inerrancy of Scripture in the sense in which it is defined in this chapter. Moreover, for these hundreds of years highly competent biblical scholars have read and studied those problem texts and still have found no difficulty in holding to inerrancy. This should give us confidence that the solutions to these problems are available and that belief in inerrancy is entirely consistent with a lifetime of detailed attention to the text of Scripture.<sup>11</sup>

But a denial of inerrancy that still claims that the words of Scripture are God-breathed words necessarily implies that God intentionally spoke falsely to us in some of the less central affirmations of Scripture. But if this is right for God to do, how can it be wrong for us? Such a line of reasoning would, if we believed it, exert strong pressure on us to begin to speak untruthfully in situations where that might seem to help us communicate better, and so forth. This position would be a slippery slope with ever-increasing negative results in our own lives.

This will have a detrimental effect on our ability to take God at his word and trust him completely or obey him fully in the rest of Scripture. We will begin to disobey initially those sections of Scripture that we least wish to obey, and to distrust initially those sections that we are least inclined to trust. But such a procedure will eventually increase, to the great detriment of our spiritual lives. Of course, such a decline in trust and obedience to Scripture may not necessarily follow in the life of every individual who denies inerrancy, but this will certainly be the general pattern, and it will be the pattern exhibited over the course of a generation that is taught to deny inerrancy.

Such a procedure, making our own minds to be a higher standard of truth than God&rsquo;s Word, is the root of all intellectual sin.<sup>12</sup>

		<p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp; A good defense of this position can be found in a collection of essays edited by Jack Rogers, <span style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Authority</span> (Waco, Tex.: Word, 1977); and, more extensively, in Jack B. Rogers and Donald McKim, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible: An Historical Approach</span> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1979).</p><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Until about 1960 or 1965 the word <span style="font-style:italic;">infallible</span> was used interchangeably with the word <span style="font-style:italic;">inerrant</span>. But in recent years, at least in the United States, the word <span style="font-style:italic;">infallible</span> has been used in a weaker sense to mean that the Bible will not lead us astray in matters of faith and practice.</p><p>cf&nbsp; cf.&mdash;compare</p><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp; This is not a minor detail, but it is useful as an example of a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; fact that is affirmed in the Old Testament and one about which the author says that we have knowledge &ldquo;by faith&rdquo;; thus, faith here is explicitly said to involve trust in the truthfulness of a scientific and historical fact recorded in the Old Testament.</p><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp; In theological terms, these original copies are called the &ldquo;autographs,&rdquo; using the prefix <span lang="el">αυτο</span>&mdash;meaning &ldquo;self,&rdquo; and the root <span lang="el">γραφ</span> meaning &ldquo;writing,&rdquo; to refer to a copy written by the author himself.</p><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp; An excellent survey of the work of studying textual variants in the extant manuscripts of the New Testament is Bruce M. Metzger, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration</span> 2d ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968).</p><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp; Of course the theoretical possibility exists that there was a copying error in the very first copy made of one of Paul&rsquo;s epistles, for instance, and that this error has been reproduced in all remaining copies. But this must be thought unlikely because (1) it would require that only one copy was made of the original, or that only one copy was the basis for all other extant copies, and (2) our earlier argument about the faithfulness of God in preserving the canon (see chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.1.3.0.0.0.0.0">3</a>, p. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.p_65">65</a>) would seem to imply that if such a mistake did occur, it would not be one that would materially affect our understanding of Scripture. The existence of such a copying error cannot be either proven or disproven, but further speculation about it apart from hard evidence does not appear to be profitable.</p><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp; An explanation of this view can be found in Daniel P. Fuller, &ldquo;Benjamin B. Warfield&rsquo;s View of Faith and History,&rdquo; <span style="font-style:italic;">BETS</span> 11 (1968): 75&ndash;83.</p><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp; The interested reader may consult, for example, Gleason L. Archer, <span style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties</span> (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982); William Arndt, <span style="font-style:italic;">Does the Bible Contradict Itself?</span> (St. Louis: Concordia, 1955); idem., <span style="font-style:italic;">Bible Difficulties</span> (St. Louis: Concordia, 1932); and John W. Haley, <span style="font-style:italic;">Alleged Discrepancies of the Bible</span> (1874; reprinted Grand Rapids: Baker, 1977). Almost all of the difficult texts have also received helpful analysis in the extensive notes to <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">NIV</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Study Bible</span> ed. Kenneth Barker et al. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1985).</p><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp; J.P. Moreland, &ldquo;The Rationality of Belief in Inerrancy,&rdquo; in <span style="font-style:italic;">TrinJ</span> 7:1 (1986): <a href="logosres:gs-trinj-07;ref=VolumePage.V_7,_pp_75-86">75&ndash;86</a>, argues convincingly that Christians should not abandon the doctrine of inerrancy simply because of a small number of &ldquo;problem texts&rdquo; for which they presently have no clear solution.</p><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp; The present writer, for example, has during the last twenty years examined dozens of these &ldquo;problem texts&rdquo; that have been brought to his attention in the context of the inerrancy debate. In every one of those cases, upon close inspection of the text a plausible solution has become evident.</p><p><sup>11</sup>&nbsp; On the history of inerrancy in the church, see the essays by Philip Hughes, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, W. Robert Godfrey, and John D. Woodbridge and Randall H. Balmer in <span style="font-style:italic;">Scripture and Truth</span>. See also the more extensive study by John D.

Some people (probably inconsistently) will deny inerrancy but not take these next logical steps. In debates over inerrancy, as in other theological discussions, it is important that we criticize people on the basis of views they actually hold, and distinguish those views clearly from positions we think they would hold if they were consistent with their stated views.</p><p>ed&nbsp; ed.&mdash;edited by, edition</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;">EDT</span>&nbsp; <span style="font-style:italic;">EDT</span>&mdash;<span style="font-style:italic;">Evangelical Dictionary of Theology.</span> Walter Elwell, ed.

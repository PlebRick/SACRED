		<span style="font-weight:bold;">EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A consideration of the subject of miracles is closely connected with God&rsquo;s providence, which was considered in the previous chapter. There we argued that God exercises an extensive, ongoing, sovereign control over all aspects of his creation. This chapter will assume an understanding of that discussion of providence and will build on it in approaching the question of miracles.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Definition</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define a miracle as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">A miracle is a less common kind of God&rsquo;s activity in which he arouses people&rsquo;s awe and wonder and bears witness to himself</span>. This definition takes into account our previous understanding of God&rsquo;s providence whereby God preserves, controls, and governs all things. If we understand providence in this way, we will naturally avoid some other common explanations or definitions of miracles.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For example, one definition of miracle is &ldquo;a direct intervention of God in the world.&rdquo; But this definition assumes a deistic view of God&rsquo;s relationship to the world, in which the world continues on its own and God only intervenes in it occasionally. This is certainly not the biblical view, according to which God makes the rain to fall (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.45">Matt. 5:45</a>), causes the grass to grow (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps104.14">Ps. 104:14</a>), and continually carries along all things by his word of power (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.3">Heb. 1:3</a>). Another definition of miracle is &ldquo;a more direct activity of God in the world.&rdquo; But to talk about a &ldquo;more direct&rdquo; working of God suggests that his <span style="font-style:italic;">ordinary</span> providential activity is somehow not &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and again hints at a sort of deistic removal of God from the world.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another definition is &ldquo;God working in the world without using means to bring about the results he wishes.&rdquo; Yet to speak of God working &ldquo;without means&rdquo; leaves us with very few if any miracles in the Bible, for it is hard to think of a miracle that came about with no means at all: in the healing of people, for example, some of the physical properties of the sick person&rsquo;s body were doubtless involved as part of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 356  </span>the healing. When Jesus multiplied the loaves and fishes, he at least used the original five loaves and two fishes that were there. When he changed water to wine, he used water and made it become wine. This definition seems to be inadequate.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet another definition of miracle is &ldquo;an exception to a natural law&rdquo; or &ldquo;God acting contrary to the laws of nature.&rdquo; But the phrase &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; in popular understanding implies that there are certain qualities inherent in the things that exist, &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; that operate independently of God, and that God must intervene or &ldquo;break&rdquo; these laws for a miracle to occur. Once again this definition does not adequately account for the biblical teaching on providence.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another definition of miracle is &ldquo;an event impossible to explain by natural causes.&rdquo; This definition is inadequate because (1) it does not include God as the one who brings about the miracle; (2) it assumes that God does not use some natural causes when he works in an unusual or amazing way, and thus it assumes again that God only occasionally intervenes in the world; and (3) it will result in a significant minimizing of actual miracles and an increase in skepticism, since many times when God works in answer to prayer the result is amazing to those who prayed but it is not absolutely impossible to explain by natural causes, especially for a skeptic who simply refuses to see God&rsquo;s hand at work.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore, the original definition given above, where a miracle is simply a <span style="font-style:italic;">less common</span> way of God&rsquo;s working in the world, seems to be preferable and more consistent with the biblical doctrine of God&rsquo;s providence. This definition does not say that a miracle is a different kind of working by God, but only that it is a less common way of God&rsquo;s working and that it is done so as to arouse people&rsquo;s surprise, awe, or amazement in such a way that God bears witness to himself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The biblical terminology for miracles frequently points to this idea of God&rsquo;s power at work to arouse people&rsquo;s wonder and amazement. Primarily three sets of terms are employed: (1) &ldquo;sign&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">אֹות</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK253">H253</a>; Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">σημεῖον</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4956">G4956</a>), which means something that points to or indicates something else, especially (with reference to miracles) God&rsquo;s activity and power; (2) &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">מֹופֵת</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK4603">H4603</a>; Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">τέρας</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5469">G5469</a>), an event that causes people to be amazed or astonished; and (3) &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; or &ldquo;mighty work&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">גְּבוּרָה</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK1476">H1476</a>; Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">δύναμις</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1539">G1539</a>), an act displaying great power, especially (with reference to miracles) divine power. Often &ldquo;signs and wonders&rdquo; is used as a stock expression to refer to miracles (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex7.3">Ex. 7:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt6.22">Deut. 6:22</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps135.9">Ps. 135:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.30">Acts 4:30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.12">5:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.19">Rom. 15:19</a>; et al.), and sometimes all three terms are combined, &ldquo;mighty works and wonders and signs&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.22">Acts 2:22</a>) or &ldquo;signs and wonders and mighty works&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Cor. 12:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.4">Heb. 2:4</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 357  </span>In addition to the meanings of the terms used for miracles, another reason supporting our definition is the fact that miracles in Scripture do arouse people&rsquo;s awe and amazement and indicate that God&rsquo;s power is at work. The Bible frequently tells us that God himself is the one who performs &ldquo;miracles&rdquo; or &ldquo;wondrous things.&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps136.4">Psalm 136:4</a> says that God is the one &ldquo;who alone does great wonders&rdquo; (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps72.18">Ps. 72:18</a>). The song of Moses declares:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Who is like you, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, among the gods?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Who is like you, majestic in holiness,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		terrible in glorious deeds, doing <span style="font-style:italic;">wonders?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-right:36pt; text-align:right;" lang="en-US">
		(<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex15.11">Ex. 15:11</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, the miraculous signs that Moses did when his staff turned into a snake and back again, or when his hand became leprous and then clean again (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex4.2-8">Ex. 4:2&ndash;8</a>), were given that Moses might demonstrate to the people of Israel that God had sent him. Similarly, the miraculous signs God did by the hand of Moses and Aaron through the plagues, far surpassing the false miracles or imitation signs done by the magicians in Pharaoh&rsquo;s court (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex7.12">Ex. 7:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex8.18-19">8:18&ndash;19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex9.11">9:11</a>), showed that the people of Israel were those who worshiped the one true God. When Elijah confronted the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki18.17-40">1 Kings 18:17&ndash;40</a>), the fire from heaven demonstrated that the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> was the one true God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now if we accept the definition that a miracle is &ldquo;a less common kind of God&rsquo;s activity in which he arouses people&rsquo;s awe and wonder and bears witness to himself,&rdquo; then we may ask what kinds of things should be considered miracles. Of course, we are right to consider the incarnation of Jesus as God-man and Jesus&rsquo; resurrection from the dead as the central and most important miracles in all history. The events of the exodus such as the parting of the Red Sea and the fall of Jericho were remarkable miracles. When Jesus healed people and cleansed lepers and cast out demons, those were certainly miracles as well (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.4-5">Matt. 11:4&ndash;5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk4.36-41">Luke 4:36&ndash;41</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn2.23">John 2:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.54">4:54</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.2">6:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.30-31">20:30&ndash;31</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But can we consider unusual answers to prayer to be miracles? Apparently so, if they are remarkable enough to arouse people&rsquo;s awe and wonder and cause them to acknowledge God&rsquo;s power at work: the answer to Elijah&rsquo;s prayer that God would send fire from heaven was a miracle (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki18.24">1 Kings 18:24</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki18.36-38">36&ndash;38</a>), as were the answers to his prayers that the widow&rsquo;s dead son would come back to life (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki17.21">1 Kings 17:21</a>), or that the rain would stop and later start again (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki17.1">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki18.41-45">18:41&ndash;45</a> with <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.17-18">James 5:17&ndash;18</a>). In the New Testament, the release of Peter from prison in answer to the prayers of the church was certainly a miracle (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.5-17">Acts 12:5&ndash;17</a>; note also Paul&rsquo;s prayer for Publius&rsquo;s father in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac28.8">Acts 28:8</a>). But there must have been many miracles not nearly as dramatic as those, because Jesus healed many hundreds of people, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> that were sick with <span style="font-style:italic;">various diseases</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk4.40">Luke 4:40</a>). Paul healed &ldquo;the rest of the people on the island who had diseases&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac28.9">Acts 28:9</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, Christians see answers to prayer every day, and we should not water down our definition of miracle so much that every answer to prayer is called a miracle. But when an answer to prayer is so remarkable that people involved with it are amazed and acknowledge God&rsquo;s power at work in an unusual way, then it seems appropriate to call it a miracle. This is consistent with our <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 358  </span>definition and seems supported by the biblical evidence that works of God that aroused people&rsquo;s awe and wonder were called miracles (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">δύναμις</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1539">G1539</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But whether we adopt a broad or narrow definition of miracle, all should agree that if God really does work in answer to our prayers, whether in common or uncommon ways, it is important that we recognize this and give thanks to him, and that we not ignore it or go to great lengths to devise possible &ldquo;natural causes&rdquo; to explain away what God has in fact done in answer to prayer. While we must be careful not to exaggerate in reporting details of answers to prayer, we must also avoid the opposite error of failing to glorify and thank God for what he has done.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Miracles as Characteristic of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">New Covenant</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Age</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the New Testament, Jesus&rsquo; miraculous signs attested that he had come from God: Nicodemus recognized, &ldquo;No one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.2">John 3:2</a>). Jesus&rsquo; changing of water into wine was a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; that &ldquo;manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn2.11">John 2:11</a>). According to Peter, Jesus was &ldquo;a man attested to you by God with <span style="font-style:italic;">mighty works and wonders and signs</span> which God did through him in your midst&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.22">Acts 2:22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then in the early church, the apostles and others who preached the gospel performed miracles that amazed people and gave confirmation of the gospel that was being preached (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.43">Acts 2:43</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac3.6-10">3:6&ndash;10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.30">4:30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.6-8">8:6&ndash;8</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.13">13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.40-42">9:40&ndash;42</a>; et al.). Even in churches where no apostles were present miracles occurred. For example, Paul, in writing to several churches in the region of Galatia (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.1">Gal. 1:1</a>), assumes this when he asks, &ldquo;Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.5">Gal. 3:5</a>). Similarly, he mentions in the church at Corinth &ldquo;workers of miracles&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.28">1 Cor. 12:28</a>) and names &ldquo;the working of miracles&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.10">1 Cor. 12:10</a>) as a gift distributed by the Holy Spirit. These last two verses are especially significant because <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.4-31">1 Corinthians 12:4&ndash;31</a> is not discussing a specific situation at Corinth but the nature of the church in general as the &ldquo;body of Christ&rdquo; with many members yet one body.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 359  </span>In fact, it seems to be a characteristic of the New Testament church that miracles occur. In the Old Testament, miracles seemed to occur primarily in connection with one prominent leader at a time, such as Moses or Elijah or Elisha. In the New Testament, there is a sudden and unprecedented increase in the miracles when Jesus begins his ministry (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk4.36-37">Luke 4:36&ndash;37</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk4.40-41">40&ndash;41</a>). However, contrary to the pattern of the Old Testament, the authority to work miracles and to cast out demons was not confined to Jesus himself, nor did miracles die out when Jesus returned to heaven. Even during his ministry, Jesus gave authority to heal the sick and to cast out demons not only to the Twelve, but also to seventy of his disciples (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk10.1">Luke 10:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk10.9">9</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk10.17-19">17&ndash;19</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.8">Matt. 10:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk9.49-50">Luke 9:49&ndash;50</a>). Moreover, the passages noted above from 1 Corinthians and Galatians indicate that performing miracles was not confined to the seventy disciples, but was characteristic of the churches of Galatia and the New Testament churches generally. This suggests that the occurrence of miracles is a characteristic of the New Testament church and may be seen as an indication of the powerful new work of the Holy Spirit that began with Pentecost and may be expected to continue through the church age.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. The Purposes of Miracles</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One purpose of miracles is certainly to authenticate the message of the gospel. This was evident in Jesus&rsquo; own ministry, as people like Nicodemus acknowledged: &ldquo;We know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these <span style="font-style:italic;">signs</span> that you do, unless God is with him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.2">John 3:2</a>). It also was evident as the gospel was proclaimed by those who heard Jesus, for as they preached, &ldquo;God also bore witness by <span style="font-style:italic;">signs and wonders and various miracles</span> and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.4">Heb. 2:4</a>). Whether this purpose was valid only when the gospel was first preached (before the New Testament was written), or whether it holds good throughout the church age, depends on what we think the miracles are confirming: are they confirming only the absolute truthfulness of the words of Scripture (as the very words of God), or are miracles given to confirm the truthfulness of the gospel generally, whenever it is preached? In other words, do miracles confirm Scripture or the gospel? As we shall see below, miracles were not limited to those who wrote Scripture or spoke with absolute apostolic authority. This suggests that miracles given in confirmation of the gospel might be expected to continue throughout the church age.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 360  </span>When miracles occur, they give evidence that God is truly at work and so serve to advance the gospel: the Samaritan woman proclaimed to her village, &ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.29">John 4:29</a>), and many of the Samaritans believed in Christ. This was frequently true in Jesus&rsquo; ministry, but it was also true in the early church: when Philip went to a city in Samaria,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		the multitudes with one accord <span style="font-style:italic;">gave heed to what was said by Philip</span> when they heard him and saw the <span style="font-style:italic;">signs</span> which he did. For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was much joy in that city. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.6-8">Acts 8:6&ndash;8</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Aeneas the paralytic was healed, &ldquo;all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and <span style="font-style:italic;">they turned to the Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.35">Acts 9:35</a>). When Tabitha was raised from the dead, &ldquo;it became known throughout all Joppa, and <span style="font-style:italic;">many believed in the Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.42">Acts 9:42</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the New Testament, a second purpose of miracles is to bear witness to the fact that the kingdom of God has come and has begun to expand its beneficial results into people&rsquo;s lives, for the results of Jesus&rsquo;s miracles show the characteristics of God&rsquo;s kingdom: Jesus said, &ldquo;If it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.28">Matt. 12:28</a>). His triumph over the destructive forces of Satan showed what God&rsquo;s kingdom was like. In this way, every miracle of healing or deliverance from demonic oppression advanced the kingdom and helped fulfill Jesus&rsquo; ministry, for he came with the Spirit of the Lord on him &ldquo;to preach good news to the poor … to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk4.18">Luke 4:18</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, Jesus gave his disciples &ldquo;power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk9.1-2">Luke 9:1&ndash;2</a>). He commanded them, &ldquo;Preach as you go, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rsquo; Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.7-8">Matt. 10:7&ndash;8</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt4.23">Matt. 4:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt9.35">9:35</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.6-7">Acts 8:6&ndash;7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.13">13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A third purpose of miracles is to help those who are in need. The two blind men <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 361  </span>near Jericho cried out, &ldquo;Have mercy on us,&rdquo; and Jesus &ldquo;in pity&rdquo; healed them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt20.30">Matt. 20:30</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt20.34">34</a>). When Jesus saw a great crowd of people, &ldquo;he had compassion on them, and healed their sick&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt14.14">Matt. 14:14</a>; see also <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk7.13">Luke 7:13</a>). Here miracles give evidence of the compassion of Christ toward those in need.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A fourth purpose of miracles, related to the second, is to remove hindrances to people&rsquo;s ministries. As soon as Jesus had healed Peter&rsquo;s mother-in-law, &ldquo;she rose and served him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt8.15">Matt. 8:15</a>). When God had mercy on Epaphroditus and restored his health (whether through miraculous means or not, Paul attributes it to God&rsquo;s mercy in <a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.27">Phil. 2:27</a>), Epaphroditus was then able to minister to Paul and complete his function as a messenger returning to the Philippian church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.25-30">Phil. 2:25&ndash;30</a>). Although the text does not explicitly say that Tabitha (or Dorcas) resumed her &ldquo;good works and acts of charity&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.36">Acts 9:36</a>) after the Lord through Peter raised her from the dead (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.40-41">Acts 9:40&ndash;41</a>), by mentioning her good works and those who bore witness to her selfless care for the needs of others (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.39">Acts 9:39</a>), it suggests that she would resume a similar ministry of mercy when she was raised from the dead. Related to this category would be the fact that Paul expects people to be edified when miraculous gifts are used in the church (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.7">1 Cor. 12:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.4">14:4</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.12">12</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.26">26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, a fifth purpose for miracles (and one to which all the others contribute) is to bring glory to God. After Jesus healed a paralytic, the crowds &ldquo;were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt9.8">Matt. 9:8</a>). Similarly, Jesus said that the man who had been blind from birth was blind &ldquo;that the works of God might be made manifest in him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn9.3">John 9:3</a>).

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. An Unusual Concentration of Miracles in the Apostles&rsquo; Ministry</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Some have argued that miracles were restricted to the apostles or to the apostles and those closely connected with them. Before considering their arguments, it is important to note that there are some indications that a remarkable concentration of miracles was characteristic of the apostles as special representatives of Christ. For example, God was pleased to allow extraordinary miracles to be done through both Peter and Paul. In the very early days of the church,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles … And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women, so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.12-16">Acts 5:12&ndash;16</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, when Paul was in Ephesus, &ldquo;God did <span style="font-style:italic;">extraordinary miracles</span> by the hands of Paul, so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac19.11-12">Acts 19:11&ndash;12</a>). Another example is found in the raising of Tabitha: when she had died, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 362  </span>disciples at Joppa sent for Peter to come and pray for her to be raised from the dead (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.36-42">Acts 9:36&ndash;42</a>), apparently because they thought that God had given an unusual concentration of miraculous power to Peter (or to the apostles generally). And Paul&rsquo;s ministry generally was characterized by miraculous events, because he summarizes his ministry by telling the Romans of the things that Christ had worked through him to win obedience from the Gentiles &ldquo;by the power of <span style="font-style:italic;">signs and wonders</span> by the power of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.19">Rom. 15:19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, the unusual concentration of miracles in the ministries of the apostles does not prove that <span style="font-style:italic;">no</span> miracles were performed by others! As we have clearly seen, the &ldquo;working of miracles&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.10">1 Cor. 12:10</a>) and other miraculous gifts (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.4-11">1 Cor. 12:4&ndash;11</a> mentions several) were part of the ordinary functioning of the Corinthian church, and Paul knows that God &ldquo;works miracles&rdquo; in the churches of Galatia as well (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.5">Gal. 3:5</a>).
	</p>

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. What Are the &ldquo;Signs of an Apostle&rdquo; in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12"><span style="font-weight:bold;">2 Corinthians 12:12</span></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">?</span> Why then have some argued that miracles were uniquely the signs that distinguished an apostle? Their case is largely based on <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>, where Paul says, &ldquo;The <span style="font-style:italic;">signs of a true apostle</span> were performed among you in all patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Cor. 12:12</a>). They say that this implies that others who were not the apostles (or their close companions) did not have that authority or could not work these miraculous signs. They further maintain that the working of the miracles ceased when the apostles and their close associates died. Therefore, they conclude, no further miracles are to be expected today. (Those who hold this position are sometimes known as &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">cessationists</span>&rdquo; since they hold to the ceasing or &ldquo;cessation&rdquo; of miracles early in the history of the church.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In considering this question, it should be remembered that in the key passage used to establish this point, where Paul talks about &ldquo;the signs of a true apostle&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>, he is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> attempting to prove that he is an apostle <span style="font-style:italic;">in distinction from other Christians</span> who are not apostles. He is rather attempting to prove that he is a true representative of Christ in distinction from others who are &ldquo;false apostles&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.13">2 Cor. 11:13</a>), false representatives of Christ, servants of Satan who are disguising themselves as &ldquo;servants of righteousness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.14-15">2 Cor. 11:14&ndash;15</a>). In short, the contrast is not between apostles who could work miracles and ordinary Christians who could not, but between genuine Christian apostles through whom the Holy Spirit worked and <span style="font-style:italic;">non-Christian pretenders to the apostolic office</span> through whom the Holy Spirit did not work at all. Therefore, even if we understand the &ldquo;signs of an apostle&rdquo; to be miracles, we should recognize that those who use this passage to argue that miracles cannot be done through <span style="font-style:italic;">Christians</span> today are taking the phrase &ldquo;signs of an apostle&rdquo; out of its context and using it in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 363  </span>way that Paul never intended. Paul is distinguishing himself from non-Christians, whereas they use the passage to distinguish Paul from other Christians.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, a close examination of <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a> shows it to be very doubtful that the phrase &ldquo;signs of an apostle&rdquo; in this passage means miraculous signs. In this very verse, Paul distinguishes the &ldquo;signs of a true apostle&rdquo; from miracles, which he calls &ldquo;signs and wonders and mighty works,&rdquo; noting that the miracles were done along with the signs of an apostle: &ldquo;The <span style="font-style:italic;">signs of a true apostle</span> were performed among you in all patience, <span style="font-style:italic;">with signs and wonders and mighty works.</span>&rdquo; The latter phrase, &ldquo;with signs and wonders and mighty works,&rdquo; has a piling up of all three terms used for miracles and therefore must refer to miracles (note &ldquo;signs and wonders&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.30">Acts 4:30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.12">5:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.3">14:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.12">15:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.19">Rom. 15:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.4">Heb. 2:4</a>; et al.). Therefore the former phrase, &ldquo;signs of a true apostle,&rdquo; must refer to something different, something that was <span style="font-style:italic;">accompanied by</span> (done &ldquo;with&rdquo;) signs and wonders.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, although the word <span style="font-style:italic;">sign</span> in Greek (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">σημεῖον</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4956">G4956</a>) often refers to miracles, it has a much broader range of meaning than just <span style="font-style:italic;">miracle: semeion</span> simply means &ldquo;something which indicates or refers to something else.&rdquo; In <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>, the &ldquo;signs&rdquo; of an apostle are best understood as everything that characterized Paul&rsquo;s apostolic mission and showed him to be a true apostle. We need not guess at what these signs were, for elsewhere in 2 Corinthians Paul tells what marked him as a true apostle:

		The first item may have included miracles, but that is certainly not the primary focus of his reference to the &ldquo;signs of a true apostle.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another evidence that the &ldquo;signs of a true apostle&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a> were all these things and not simply miracles is the fact that Paul says, &ldquo;The signs of a true apostle were performed among you <span style="font-style:italic;">in all patience.</span>&rdquo; Now it would make little sense to say that miracles were performed &ldquo;in all patience,&rdquo; for many miracles happen quite quickly, but it would make much sense to say that Paul&rsquo;s Christlike endurance of hardship for the sake of the Corinthians was performed &ldquo;in all patience.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should note that nowhere in this list does Paul claim miracles to prove his genuine apostleship. In fact, most of the things he mentions would not distinguish him from other true Christians. But these things do distinguish him from servants of Satan, false apostles who are not Christians at all: their lives will not be marked by humility, but pride; not by selflessness, but selfishness; not by generosity, but greed; not by seeking the advantage of others, but by taking advantage of others; not by spiritual power in physical weakness, but by confidence in their natural strength; not by enduring suffering and hardship, but by seeking their own comfort and ease. When Paul acted in a Christlike manner among them, his actions were &ldquo;signs&rdquo; that his claim to be an apostle was a true claim: thus, these things were &ldquo;signs of a true apostle.&rdquo; In this context, the &ldquo;signs&rdquo; that mark a true apostle need not be things that showed an absolute difference between him and other Christians, but rather things that showed his ministry to be genuine, in distinction from false ministries. He is not here telling the Corinthians how to tell who an apostle was in distinction from other Christians (he did that in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co9.1-2">1 Cor. 9:1&ndash;2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.7-11">15:7&ndash;11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.1">Gal. 1:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.11-24">11&ndash;24</a>, mentioning seeing the risen Christ and being commissioned by him as an apostle), but here he is telling how to recognize what a genuine, Christ-approved ministry was.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Why then does he add that all these signs of a true apostle were done among the Corinthians &ldquo;with signs and wonders and mighty works&rdquo;? He is simply adding one additional factor to all the previous marks of his genuine apostleship. Miracles of course had a significant function in confirming the truth of Paul&rsquo;s message, and Paul here makes explicit what the Corinthians may or may not have assumed to be included in the phrase &ldquo;signs of a true apostle&rdquo;: in addition to all these other signs of a true apostle, his ministry showed miraculous demonstrations of God&rsquo;s power as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 365  </span>There is yet another very significant reason why miracles did not prove someone to be an apostle. In the larger context of the New Testament it is clear that miracles were worked by others than apostles, such as Stephen (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.8">Acts 6:8</a>), Philip (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.6-7">Acts 8:6&ndash;7</a>), Christians in the several churches in Galatia (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.5">Gal. 3:5</a>), and those with gifts of &ldquo;miracles&rdquo; in the body of Christ generally (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.10">1 Cor. 12:10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.28">28</a>). Miracles as such cannot then be regarded as exclusively signs of an apostle. In fact, &ldquo;workers of miracles&rdquo; and &ldquo;healers&rdquo; are actually distinguished from &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.28">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>: &ldquo;And God has appointed in the church first <span style="font-style:italic;">apostles</span> second prophets, third teachers, then <span style="font-style:italic;">workers of miracles</span> then healers …&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similar evidence is seen in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk16.17-18">Mark 16:17&ndash;18</a>: Though there are serious questions about the authenticity of this passage as part of Mark&rsquo;s gospel, the text is nonetheless very early and at least bears witness to one strand of tradition within the early church. This text reports Jesus as saying,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here also the power to work miracles is assumed to be the common possession of Christians. Those who wrote and passed on this early tradition, and who thought it represented the genuine teaching of Jesus, were certainly not aware of any idea that miracles were to be limited to the apostles and their close associates.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The argument that many other Christians in the New Testament worked miracles is sometimes answered by the claim that it was only the apostles <span style="font-style:italic;">and those closely associated with them</span> or those on whom the apostles laid their hands who could work miracles. However, this really proves very little because the story of the New Testament church is the story of what was done through the apostles and those closely associated with them. A similar argument might be made about evangelism or the founding of churches: &ldquo;In the New Testament, churches were only founded by the apostles or their close associates; therefore, we should not found churches today.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;In the New Testament, missionary work in other countries was only done by the apostles or their close associates; therefore, we should not do missionary work in other countries today.&rdquo; These analogies show the inadequacy of the argument: the New Testament primarily shows how the church <span style="font-style:italic;">should</span> seek to act, not how it <span style="font-style:italic;">should not</span> seek to act.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But if many other Christians throughout the first-century church were working miracles by the power of the Holy Spirit, then the power to work miracles could not be a sign to distinguish the apostles from other Christians.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 366  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Norman Geisler&rsquo;s Restrictive Definition of Miracles</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> A more recent attempt to deny that miracles occur today has been made by Norman Geisler. Geisler has a much more restrictive definition of <span style="font-style:italic;">miracle</span> than that presented in this chapter, and he uses that definition to argue against the possibility of contemporary miracles. Geisler says that &ldquo;miracles (1) are always successful, (2) are immediate, (3) have no relapses, and (4) give confirmation of God&rsquo;s messenger&rdquo; (pp. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/sc-pnngsw?ref=Page.pp+28-30">28&ndash;30</a>). He finds support for this thesis largely in the ministry of Jesus, but when he passes beyond the life of Jesus and attempts to show that others who had the power to work miracles were never unsuccessful, his thesis is much less convincing. With regard to the demon-possessed boy whom the disciples could not set free from the demon (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt17.14-21">Matt. 17:14&ndash;21</a>), Geisler says that &ldquo;the disciples simply forgot for the moment to faithfully exercise the power that Jesus had already given them&rdquo; (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/sc-pnngsw?ref=Page.p+150">150</a>). But this is an unpersuasive argument: Geisler says that the power to work miracles was always successful, and when the Bible talks about some who were unsuccessful (and who contradict his thesis) he simply says they &ldquo;forgot.&rdquo; Jesus, however, gives a different reason than Geisler: &ldquo;Because of your little faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt17.20">Matt. 17:20</a>). Lesser faith resulted in lesser power to work miracles.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With regard to Paul&rsquo;s failure to heal Epaphroditus (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.27">Phil. 2:27</a>), Geisler is forced to make the dubious claim that perhaps Paul never attempted to heal Epaphroditus (though he had come to him in prison and was so ill he almost died), or that &ldquo;Paul no longer possessed the gift of healing at this time&rdquo; (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/sc-pnngsw?ref=Page.p+150">150</a>). He employs the same claim to explain the fact that Paul left Trophimus ill at Miletus (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti4.20">2 Tim. 4:20</a>). In these instances Geisler goes well beyond the usual cessationist claim that miracles ended with the death of the apostles&mdash;he is claiming that miracles ceased in the life of the greatest apostle before his first Roman imprisonment. That is simply an unconvincing argument with respect to the apostle whose ministry was repeatedly characterized &ldquo;by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.19">Rom. 15:19</a>), and who could say with triumph in his last epistle, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti4.7">2 Tim. 4:7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Geisler&rsquo;s description of miracles does not fit the case of the blind man upon whom Jesus laid his hands, for at first the man did not see clearly but said he saw men who &ldquo;look like trees, walking.&rdquo; After Jesus laid his hands on him a second time, the man &ldquo;saw everything clearly&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk8.24-25">Mark 8:24&ndash;25</a>). Geisler responds that it was Jesus&rsquo; intention to heal in two stages, to teach the disciples by using an object lesson about the gradual growth of their spiritual lives (pp. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/sc-pnngsw?ref=Page.pp+153-154">153&ndash;54</a>). Though the text says nothing to this effect, it may have been true, but even so it disproves Geisler&rsquo;s thesis, for if it was Jesus&rsquo; intention to heal in two stages then, it may also be his intention to heal people in two stages today&mdash;or in three or four or more stages. Once Geisler admits that it may be God&rsquo;s intention to work a miracle in stages, in order to accomplish his own purposes, then his entire claim that miracles must be immediate and complete is lost.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 367  </span>Instead of accepting Geisler&rsquo;s definition, it seems better to conclude that even those whom God gifts with the ability to perform miracles may not be able to perform them whenever they wish, for the Holy Spirit continually is distributing them to each person &ldquo;as he wills&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.11">1 Cor. 12:11</a>; the word <span style="font-style:italic;">distributes</span> is a present participle in Greek, indicating a continuing activity of the Holy Spirit). Moreover, there seems no reason to exclude (as Geisler apparently wants to do) unusual or remarkable answers to prayer from the category of &ldquo;miracle,&rdquo; thus making the definition extremely restrictive. If God answers persistent prayer, for instance, for a physical healing for which there is no known medical explanation, and does so only after several months or years of prayer, yet does so in such a way that it seems quite clearly to be in response to prayer so that people are amazed and glorify God, there seems no reason to deny that a miracle has occurred simply because the earlier prayers were not answered immediately. Finally, Geisler fails to recognize that several New Testament texts indicate that spiritual gifts, whether miraculous or nonmiraculous in nature, may vary in strength or degree of intensity.

There the author says that the message of salvation &ldquo;was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Since the miracles here are said to come through those who heard the Lord firsthand (&ldquo;those who heard him&rdquo;), it is argued that we should not expect them to be done through others who were not firsthand witnesses to the Lord&rsquo;s teaching and ministry.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But this argument also attempts to draw more from the passage than is there. First, the phrase &ldquo;those who heard him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.3">Heb. 2:3</a>) is certainly not limited to the apostles, for many others heard Jesus as well. But more importantly, this position is claiming something that the text simply does not say: the fact that (1) the gospel message was confirmed by miracles when it was preached by those who heard Jesus says nothing at all about (2) whether it would be confirmed by miracles when preached by others who did not hear Jesus. Finally, this passage says the message was confirmed not only by &ldquo;signs and wonders and various miracles&rdquo; but also by &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">gifts of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span>&rdquo; If someone argues that this passage limits miracles to the apostles and their companions, then he or she must also argue that gifts of the Holy Spirit are likewise limited to the first-century church. But few would argue that there are no gifts of the Holy Spirit today.

Conclusion: Were Miracles Restricted to the Apostles?</span> If ministry in the power and glory of the Holy Spirit is characteristic of the new covenant age (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co3.1-4.18">2 Cor. 3:1&ndash;4:18</a>), then our expectation would be just the opposite: we would expect that second and third and fourth generation Christians, who also know Christ and the power of his resurrection (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.10">Phil. 3:10</a>), who are continually being filled with the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.17">Eph. 5:17</a>), who are participants in a war that is not a worldly war, but one that is carried on with weapons that have divine power to destroy strongholds (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co10.3-4">2 Cor. 10:3&ndash;4</a>), who have not been given a spirit of timidity but a &ldquo;spirit of power and love and self-control&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.7">2 Tim. 1:7</a>), who are strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might, and who have put on the whole armor of God in order to be able to stand against principalities and powers and spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.10-12">Eph. 6:10&ndash;12</a>), would <span style="font-style:italic;">also</span> have the ability to minister the gospel not only in truth and love but also with accompanying miraculous demonstrations of God&rsquo;s power. It is difficult to see, from the pages of the New Testament, any reason why only the preaching of the apostles should come &ldquo;not in plausible words of wisdom, but <span style="font-style:italic;">in demonstration of the Spirit and of power</span> that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co2.4-5">1 Cor. 2:4&ndash;5</a>).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Though there does seem to have been an unusual concentration of miraculous power in the ministry of the apostles, this is not a reason for thinking that there would be few or no miracles following their deaths. Rather, the apostles were the leaders in a new covenant church whose life and message were characterized by the power of the Holy Spirit at work in miraculous ways. Furthermore, they set a pattern that the church throughout its history may well seek to imitate in its own life, insofar as God the Holy Spirit is pleased to work miracles for the edification of the church.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">E. False Miracles</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Pharaoh&rsquo;s magicians were able to work some false miracles (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex7.11">Ex. 7:11</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex7.22">22</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex8.7">8:7</a>), though they soon had to admit that God&rsquo;s power was greater (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex8.19">Ex. 8:19</a>). Simon the sorcerer in the city of Samaria amazed people with his magic (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.9-11">Acts 8:9&ndash;11</a>), even though the miracles done through Philip were much greater (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.13">Acts 8:13</a>). In Philippi Paul encountered a slave girl &ldquo;who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by soothsaying&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.16">Acts 16:16</a>), but Paul rebuked the spirit and it came out of her (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.18">Acts 16:18</a>). Moreover, Paul says that when the man of sin comes it &ldquo;will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are to perish&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Th2.9-10">2 Thess. 2:9&ndash;10</a>), but those who follow them and are deceived do so &ldquo;because they refused to love the truth and so be saved&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Th2.10">2 Thess. 2:10</a>). This indicates that those who work false miracles in the end times by the power of Satan will not speak the truth but will <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 369  </span>preach a false gospel. Finally, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re13">Revelation 13</a> indicates that a second beast will rise &ldquo;out of the earth,&rdquo; one that has &ldquo;all the authority of the first beast&rdquo; and &ldquo;works great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men; and by the signs which it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast, it deceives those who dwell on earth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re13.11-14">Rev. 13:11&ndash;14</a>). But once again a false gospel accompanies these miracles: this power is exercised in connection with the first beast who utters &ldquo;haughty and blasphemous words … it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re13.5-6">Rev. 13:5&ndash;6</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Two conclusions become clear from this brief survey of false miracles in Scripture: (1) <span style="font-style:italic;">The power of God is greater than the power of Satan</span> to work miraculous signs, and God&rsquo;s people triumph in confrontations of power with those who work evil. In connection with this, John assures believers that &ldquo;he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.4">1 John 4:4</a>). (2) The identity of these workers of false miracles <span style="font-style:italic;">is always known through their denial of the gospel. There is no indication anywhere in Scripture that genuine Christians with the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> in them will work false miracles</span>. In fact, in a city filled with idolatry and demon worship (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.20">1 Cor. 10:20</a>), Paul could say to the Corinthian believers, many of whom had come out of that kind of pagan background, that &ldquo;no one can say &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rsquo; except by the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.3">1 Cor. 12:3</a>). Here he gives them reassurance that those who make a genuine profession of faith in Jesus as Lord do in fact have the Holy Spirit in them. It is significant that he immediately goes on to a discussion of spiritual gifts possessed by &ldquo;each&rdquo; true believer (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.7">1 Cor. 12:7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This should reassure us that if we see miracles being worked by those who make a genuine profession of faith (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.3">1 Cor. 12:3</a>), who believe in the incarnation and deity of Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.2">1 John 4:2</a>), and who show the fruit of the Holy Spirit in their lives and bear fruit in their ministry (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.20">Matt. 7:20</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.5">John 15:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.22-23">Gal. 5:22&ndash;23</a>), we should not be suspicious that they are false miracles but should be thankful to God that the Holy Spirit is working, even in those who may not hold exactly the same convictions that we do on every point of doctrine. Indeed, if God waited to work miracles only through those who were perfect in both doctrine and conduct of life, no miracles would be worked until Christ returns.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">F. Should Christians Seek Miracles Today?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is one thing to say that miracles might occur today. It is quite another thing to ask God for miracles. Is it right then for Christians to ask God to perform miracles?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 370  </span>The answer depends on the purpose for which miracles are sought. Certainly it is wrong to seek miraculous power to advance one&rsquo;s own power or fame, as Simon the magician did: Peter said to him, &ldquo;your heart is not right before God. Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.21-22">Acts 8:21&ndash;22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is also wrong to seek miracles simply to be entertained, as Herod did: &ldquo;When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.8">Luke 23:8</a>). But Jesus would not even answer Herod&rsquo;s questions.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is also wrong for skeptical unbelievers to seek miracles simply to find ground to criticize those who preach the gospel:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and <span style="font-style:italic;">to test him</span> they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. He answered them, &ldquo;… An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt16.1-4">Matt. 16:1&ndash;4</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This rebuke against seeking signs is repeated elsewhere in the Gospels, but it is important to note that rebukes against seeking signs are always directed against hostile unbelievers who are seeking a miracle only as an opportunity to criticize Jesus. Never does Jesus rebuke anyone who comes in faith, or in need, seeking healing or deliverance or any other kind of miracle, whether for himself or herself, or for others.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What shall we say then about <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.22-24">1 Corinthians 1:22&ndash;24</a>, where Paul says, &ldquo;For <span style="font-style:italic;">Jews demand signs</span> and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God&rdquo;? Does Paul mean that he did not work miracles (&ldquo;signs&rdquo;) at Corinth, or perhaps in his evangelistic work generally?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here Paul cannot be denying that he performed miracles in connection with the proclamation of the gospel. In fact, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.18-19">Romans 15:18&ndash;19</a>, a passage he wrote while in Corinth, he said,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has wrought through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed, <span style="font-style:italic;">by the power of signs and wonders</span> by the power of the Holy Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 371  </span>And <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a> affirms clearly that Paul did work &ldquo;signs and wonders and mighty works&rdquo; among them.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.22-24">1 Corinthians 1:22&ndash;24</a> cannot mean that Paul was denying the validity of <span style="font-style:italic;">wisdom</span> or the validity of <span style="font-style:italic;">signs</span> for through Christ he worked signs and he taught wisdom. Rather, here he is saying that signs and wisdom do not themselves save people, but the gospel saves people. Signs and the wisdom that Jews and Greeks were seeking were not the signs and wisdom of Christ but simply signs to entertain or to fuel their hostility and skepticism and wisdom that was the wisdom of the world rather than the wisdom of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There is nothing inappropriate in seeking miracles for the proper purposes for which they are given by God: to confirm the truthfulness of the gospel message, to bring help to those in need, to remove hindrances to people&rsquo;s ministries, and to bring glory to God (see Section <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.17.1.3.0.0.0">C</a> above). In the Gospels many people came to Jesus seeking miracles, and he healed them for these purposes. Moreover, when he sent his disciples out preaching that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, he told them, &ldquo;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.7-8">Matt. 10:7&ndash;8</a>). How could they do this without seeking God for miracles everywhere they went? Jesus&rsquo; command required them to seek for miracles to happen.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		After Pentecost, the early church prayed both for boldness to preach the gospel and for God to grant miracles to accompany its preaching. They cried out to God,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness, <span style="font-style:italic;">while you stretch out your hand to heal</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">signs and wonders</span> are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.29-30">Acts 4:29&ndash;30</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Far from teaching that we should not ask God for miracles, this example of the early church gives us some encouragement to do so. Similarly, the disciples in Lydda sent for Peter to come and pray for Tabitha after she had died, thereby seeking a miraculous intervention by God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.38">Acts 9:38</a>). And James directs that the elders of the church should pray and seek healing for those who are ill (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.14">James 5:14</a>). Of course, we should not assume that an obviously miraculous answer to prayer is somehow better than one that comes through ordinary means (such as medical help for sickness), and we must also realize that asking God for a particular need does not guarantee that the prayer will be answered. On the other hand, our faith that God will work in powerful and even miraculous ways may be far too small. We must beware of being infected by a secular worldview that assumes that God will answer prayer only very seldom, if ever. And we should certainly not be embarrassed to talk about miracles if they occur&mdash;or think that a nonmiraculous answer to prayer is better! Miracles are God&rsquo;s work, and he works them to bring glory to himself and to strengthen our faith. When we encounter serious needs in people&rsquo;s lives today, it is right for us to seek God for an answer, and where miraculous intervention seems to be needed, then to ask God if he would be pleased to work in that way. This would seem to be especially <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 372  </span>appropriate when our motivation is a Christlike compassion for those in need and a burning desire to see Christ&rsquo;s kingdom advance and his name glorified.

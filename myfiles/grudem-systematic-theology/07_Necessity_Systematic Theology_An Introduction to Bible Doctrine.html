		Explanation and Scriptural Basis

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The necessity of Scripture may be defined as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">The necessity of Scripture means that the Bible is necessary for knowing the gospel, for maintaining spiritual life, and for knowing God&rsquo;s will, but is not necessary for knowing that God exists or for knowing something about God&rsquo;s character and moral laws</span>.

		A. The Bible Is Necessary for Knowledge of the Gospel
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro10.13-17">Romans 10:13&ndash;17</a> Paul says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">
		For, &ldquo;everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.&rdquo; But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed? And <span style="font-style:italic;">how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?</span> And how are they to hear without a preacher? … So <span style="font-style:italic;">faith comes from what is heard</span> and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This statement indicates the following line of reasoning: (1) It first assumes that one must call upon the name of the Lord to be saved. (In Pauline usage generally as well as in this specific context [see v. <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro10.9">9</a>], &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; refers to the Lord Jesus Christ.) (2) People can only call upon the name of Christ if they believe in him (that is, that he is a Savior worthy of calling upon and one who will answer those who call). (3) People cannot believe in Christ unless they have heard of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 117  </span>him. (4) They cannot hear of Christ unless there is someone to tell them about Christ (a &ldquo;preacher&rdquo;). (5) The conclusion is that saving faith comes by hearing (that is, by hearing the gospel message), and this hearing of the gospel message comes about through the preaching of Christ. The implication seems to be that without hearing the preaching of the gospel of Christ, no one can be saved.<sup>2</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This passage is one of several that show that eternal salvation comes only through belief in Jesus Christ and no other way. Speaking of Christ, <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn3.18">John 3:18</a> says, &ldquo;He who believes in him is not condemned; <span style="font-style:italic;">he who does not believe is condemned already</span> because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.&rdquo; Similarly, in <a href="logosref:Bible.Jn14.6">John 14:6</a> Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; <span style="font-style:italic;">no one comes to the Father, but by me.</span>&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Peter, on trial before the Sanhedrin, says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">there is salvation in no one else</span> for there is <span style="font-style:italic;">no other name</span> under heaven given among men by which we must be saved&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ac4.12">Acts 4:12</a>). Of course, the exclusiveness of salvation through Christ is because Jesus is the only one who ever died for our sins or whoever could have done so. Paul says, &ldquo;For there is one God, and <span style="font-style:italic;">there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all</span> …&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.1Ti2.5-6">1 Tim. 2:5&ndash;6</a>). There is no other way to be reconciled to God than through Christ, for there is no other way of dealing with the guilt of our sin before a holy God.<sup>3</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		But if people can be saved only through faith in Christ, someone might ask how believers under the old covenant could have been saved. The answer must be that those who were saved under the old covenant were also saved through trusting in Christ, even though their faith was a forward-looking faith based on God&rsquo;s word of promise that a Messiah or a Redeemer would come. Speaking of Old Testament believers such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Sarah, the author of Hebrews says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">These all died in faith</span> not having received what was promised, but <span style="font-style:italic;">having seen it and greeted it from afar</span> …&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Heb11.13">Heb. 11:13</a>). The same chapter goes on to say that Moses &ldquo;considered abuse suffered <span style="font-style:italic;">for the Christ</span> (or the Messiah) greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked to the reward&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Heb11.26">Heb. 11:26</a>). And Jesus can say of Abraham, &ldquo;Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; <span style="font-style:italic;">he saw it</span> and was glad&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Jn8.56">John 8:56</a>). This again apparently refers to Abraham&rsquo;s joy in looking forward to the day of the promised Messiah. Thus, even Old Testament believers had saving faith in Christ, to whom they looked forward, not with exact knowledge of the historical details of Christ&rsquo;s life, but with great faith in the absolute reliability of God&rsquo;s word of promise.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The Bible is necessary for salvation, then, in this sense: one must either read the gospel message in the Bible for oneself, or hear it from another person. Even those believers who came to salvation in the old covenant did so by trusting in the words of God that promised a Savior to come.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, these repeated instances of people trusting in God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">words</span> of promise, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 118  </span>together with the verses above that affirm the necessity of hearing about and believing in Christ, seem to indicate that sinful people need more on which to rest their faith than just an intuitive guess that God might provide a means of salvation. It seems that the only foundation firm enough to rest one&rsquo;s faith on is the <span style="font-style:italic;">word</span> of God itself (whether spoken or written). This in the earliest times came in very brief form, but from the very beginning we have evidence of <span style="font-style:italic;">words</span> of God promising a salvation yet to come, words that were trusted by those people whom God called to himself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		For example, even in the lifetime of Adam and Eve there are some words of God that point toward a future salvation: in <a href="logosref:Bible.Ge3.15">Genesis 3:15</a> the curse on the serpent includes a promise that the seed of the woman (one of her descendants) would bruise the head of the serpent but would himself be hurt in the process&mdash;a promise ultimately fulfilled in Christ. The fact that the first two children of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, offered sacrifices to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ge4.3-4">Gen. 4:3&ndash;4</a>) indicates their consciousness of a need to make some kind of payment for the guilt of their sin, and of God&rsquo;s promise of acceptance of sacrifices offered in the right way. <a href="logosref:Bible.Ge4.7">Genesis 4:7</a>, &ldquo;If you do well, will you not be accepted?&rdquo; indicates again in the very briefest form a word from God that offered the provision of some kind of salvation through trusting in the promise of God offered in that word. As the history of the Old Testament progressed, God&rsquo;s words of promise became more and more specific, and the forward-looking faith of God&rsquo;s people accordingly became more and more definite. Yet it seems always to have been a faith resting specifically on the <span style="font-style:italic;">words</span> of God himself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, although it will be argued below that people can know that God <span style="font-style:italic;">exists</span> and can know something of his <span style="font-style:italic;">laws</span> apart from Scripture, it seems that there is no possibility of coming to <span style="font-style:italic;">saving faith</span> apart from specific knowledge of God&rsquo;s words of promise.<sup>*</sup>

		B. The Bible Is Necessary for Maintaining Spiritual Life
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus says in <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt4.4">Matthew 4:4</a> (quoting <a href="logosref:Bible.Dt8.3">Deut. 8:3</a>), &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God&rdquo; (NASB
		
			
		). Here Jesus indicates that our spiritual life is maintained by daily nourishment with the Word of God, just as our physical lives are maintained by daily nourishment with physical food. To neglect regular reading of God&rsquo;s Word is as detrimental to the health of our souls as the neglect of physical food is detrimental to the health of our bodies.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, Moses tells the people of Israel of the importance of God&rsquo;s words for their lives: &ldquo;For it is no trifle for you, but <span style="font-style:italic;">it is your life</span> and thereby you shall live long in the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt32.47">Deut. 32:47</a>). And Peter encourages the Christians to whom he writes, &ldquo;Like newborn babes, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up to salvation&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.1Pe2.2">1 Peter 2:2</a>). The &ldquo;pure spiritual milk&rdquo; in this context must refer to the Word of God about which Peter has been speaking (see <a href="logosref:Bible.1Pe1.23-25">1 Peter 1:23&ndash;25</a>). The Bible, then, is necessary for maintaining spiritual life and for growth in the Christian life.

		C. The Bible Is Necessary for Certain Knowledge of God&rsquo;s Will
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		It will be argued below that all people ever born have <span style="font-style:italic;">some</span> knowledge of God&rsquo;s will through their consciences. But this knowledge is often indistinct and cannot give certainty. In fact, if there were <span style="font-style:italic;">no</span> written Word of God, we <span style="font-style:italic;">could not</span> gain certainty about God&rsquo;s will through other means such as conscience, advice from others, an internal witness of the Holy Spirit, changed circumstances, and the use of sanctified reasoning and common sense. These all might give an approximation of God&rsquo;s will in more or less reliable ways, but from these means alone no certainty about God&rsquo;s will could ever be attained, at least in a fallen world where sin distorts our perception of right and wrong, brings faulty reasoning into our thinking processes, and causes us to suppress from time to time the testimony of our consciences (cf
		
			
		. <a href="logosref:Bible.Je17.9">Jer. 17:9</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro2.14-15">Rom. 2:14&ndash;15</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.1Co8.10">1 Cor. 8:10</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Heb5.14">Heb. 5:14</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Heb10.22">10:22</a>; also <a href="logosref:Bible.1Ti4.2">1 Tim. 4:2</a>; <a href="logosref:Bible.Tt1.15">Titus 1:15</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In the Bible, however, we have clear and definite statements about God&rsquo;s will. God has not revealed all things to us, but he has revealed enough for us to know his will: &ldquo;The secret things belong to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> our God; but <span style="font-style:italic;">the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever</span> that we may do all the words of this law&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Dt29.29">Deut. 29:29</a>). As it was in the time of Moses, so it is now with us: God has revealed his words to us that we might obey his laws and thereby do his will. To be &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; in God&rsquo;s sight is to &ldquo;walk in the law of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps119.1">Ps. 119:1</a>). The &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; man is one who does not follow the will of wicked people (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps1.1">Ps. 1:1</a>), but delights &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">in the law of the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span>&rdquo; and meditates on God&rsquo;s law &ldquo;day and night&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps1.2">Ps. 1:2</a>). To love God (and thereby to act in a way that is pleasing to him) is to &ldquo;keep his commandments&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.1Jn5.3">1 John 5:3</a>). If we are to have a certain knowledge of God&rsquo;s will, then, we must attain it through the study of Scripture.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, in one sense it can be argued that the Bible is necessary for certain knowledge about anything. A philosopher might argue as follows: The fact that we do not know everything requires us to be uncertain about everything we do claim to know. This is because some fact unknown to us may yet turn out to prove that what we thought to be true was actually false. For example, we think we know our date of birth, our name, our age, and so forth. But we must admit that it is possible that some day we could find that our parents had given us false information and our &ldquo;certain&rdquo; knowledge would then turn out to be incorrect. Regarding events that we personally have experienced, we all realize how it is possible for us to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; words or events incorrectly and find ourselves later corrected by more accurate information. We can usually be more certain about the events of our present experience, so long as it remains present (but even that, someone might argue, could be a dream, and we will only discover this fact when we wake up!). At any rate, it is difficult to answer the philosopher&rsquo;s question: If we do not know <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> the facts in the universe, past, present, and future, how can we ever attain <span style="font-style:italic;">certainty</span> that we have correct information about any one fact?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Ultimately, there are only two possible solutions to this problem: (1) We must learn all the facts of the universe in order to be sure that no subsequently discovered fact will prove our present ideas to be false; or (2) someone who <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> know all the facts in the universe, and who never lies, could tell us some true facts that we can then be sure will never be contradicted.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This second solution is in fact what we have when we have God&rsquo;s words in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 120  </span>Scripture. God knows all facts that ever have been or ever will be. And this God who is omniscient (all-knowing) has absolutely certain knowledge: there can never be any fact that he does not already know; thus, there can never be any fact that would prove that something God thinks is actually false. Now it is from this infinite storehouse of certain knowledge that God, who never lies, has spoken to us in Scripture, in which he has told us many true things about himself, about ourselves, and about the universe that he has made. No fact can ever turn up to contradict the truth spoken by this one who is omniscient.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, it is appropriate for us to be <span style="font-style:italic;">more certain</span> about the truths we read in Scripture than about any other knowledge we have. If we are to talk about degrees of certainty of knowledge we have, then the knowledge we attain from Scripture would have the highest degree of certainty: if the word &ldquo;certain&rdquo; can be applied to any kind of human knowledge, it can be applied to this knowledge.<sup>4</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This concept of the certainty of knowledge that we attain from Scripture then gives us a reasonable basis for affirming the correctness of much of the other knowledge that we have. We read Scripture and find that its view of the world around us, of human nature, and of ourselves corresponds closely to the information we have gained from our own sense-experiences of the world around us. Thus we are encouraged to trust our sense-experiences of the world around us: our observations correspond with the absolute truth of Scripture; therefore, our observations are also true and, by and large, reliable. Such confidence in the general reliability of observations made with our eyes and ears is further confirmed by the fact that it is God who has made these faculties and who in Scripture frequently encourages us to use them (compare also <a href="logosref:Bible.Pr20.12">Prov. 20:12</a>: &ldquo;The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> has made them both&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In this way the Christian who takes the Bible as God&rsquo;s Word escapes from philosophical skepticism about the possibility of attaining certain knowledge with our finite minds. In this sense, then, it is correct to say that for people who are not omniscient, the Bible is necessary for certain knowledge about anything.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		This fact is important for the following discussion, where we affirm that unbelievers <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> know something about God from the general revelation that is <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 121  </span>seen in the world around them. Although this is true, we must recognize that in a fallen world knowledge gained by observation of the world is always imperfect and always liable to error or misinterpretation. Therefore the knowledge of God and creation gained from Scripture must be used to interpret correctly the creation around us. Using the theological terms that we will define below, we can say that we need special revelation to interpret general revelation rightly.<sup>5</sup>

		D. But the Bible Is Not Necessary for Knowing That God Exists
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		What about people who do not read the Bible? Can they obtain any knowledge of God? Can they know anything about his laws? Yes, without the Bible some knowledge of God is possible, even if it is not absolutely certain knowledge.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		People can obtain a knowledge <span style="font-style:italic;">that God exists</span> and a knowledge of <span style="font-style:italic;">some of his attributes</span> simply from observation of themselves and the world around them. David says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The heavens are telling the glory of God</span>; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ps19.1">Ps. 19:1</a>). To look at the sky is to see evidence of the infinite power, wisdom, and even beauty of God; it is to observe a majestic witness to the glory of God. Similarly, Barnabas and Paul tell the Greek inhabitants of Lystra about the living God who made the heavens and the earth: &ldquo;In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways; yet <span style="font-style:italic;">he did not leave himself without witness</span> for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ac14.16-17">Acts 14:16&ndash;17</a>). Rains and fruitful seasons, food produced from the earth, and gladness in people&rsquo;s hearts, all bear witness to the fact that their Creator is a God of mercy, of love, and even of joy. These evidences of God are all around us in creation to be seen by those who are willing to see them.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Even those who by their wickedness suppress the truth cannot avoid the evidences of God&rsquo;s existence and nature in the created order:

	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">
		For <span style="font-style:italic;">what can be known about God is plain to them</span> because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world <span style="font-style:italic;">his invisible nature</span> namely, his eternal power and deity, <span style="font-style:italic;">has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made</span>. So they are without excuse; for although <span style="font-style:italic;">they knew God</span> they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened. (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ro1.19-21">Rom. 1:19&ndash;21</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Here Paul says not only that creation gives evidence of God&rsquo;s existence and character, but also that even wicked men recognize that evidence. What can be known about God is &ldquo;plain to them&rdquo; and in fact &ldquo;they knew God&rdquo; (apparently, they knew who he was), but &ldquo;they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him.&rdquo; This passage allows us to say that all persons, even the most wicked, have some internal knowledge or perception that God exists and that he is a powerful Creator. This knowledge is seen &ldquo;in the things that have been made,&rdquo; a phrase that refers to all creation. Yet it is probably in seeing mankind created in the image of God&mdash;that is, in seeing both themselves and other people&mdash;that even wicked persons see the greatest evidence of God&rsquo;s existence and nature.<sup>6</sup>

Speaking of a long list of sins (&ldquo;envy, murder, strife, deceit …&rdquo;), Paul says of wicked people who practice them, &ldquo;Though <span style="font-style:italic;">they know God&rsquo;s decree that those who do such things deserve to die</span> they not only do them but approve those who practice them&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ro1.32">Rom. 1:32</a>). Wicked people know that their sin is wrong, at least in large measure.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Paul then talks about the activity of conscience in Gentiles who do not have the written law:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-bottom:9pt; margin-left:36pt;" lang="en-US">
		When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that <span style="font-style:italic;">what the law requires is written on their hearts</span> while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them …&rdquo; (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ro2.14-15">Rom. 2:14&ndash;15</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The consciences of unbelievers bear witness to God&rsquo;s moral standards, but at times this evidence of God&rsquo;s law on the hearts of unbelievers is distorted or suppressed.<sup>7</sup>
		
			
		 Sometimes their thoughts &ldquo;accuse&rdquo; them and sometimes their thoughts &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; them, Paul says. The knowledge of God&rsquo;s laws derived from such sources is never perfect, but it is enough to give an awareness of God&rsquo;s moral demands to all mankind. (And it is on this basis that Paul argues that all humanity is held guilty before God for sin, even those who do not have the written laws of God in Scripture.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The knowledge of God&rsquo;s existence, character, and moral law, which comes through creation to all humanity, is often called &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">general revelation</span>&rdquo; (because it comes to all people generally).<sup>8</sup>
		
			
		 General revelation comes through observing nature, through seeing God&rsquo;s directing influence in history, and through an inner <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 123  </span>sense of God&rsquo;s existence and his laws that he has placed inside every person. General revelation is distinct from &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">special revelation</span>&rdquo; which refers to God&rsquo;s words addressed to specific people, such as the words of the Bible, the words of the Old Testament prophets and New Testament apostles, and the words of God spoken in personal address, such as at Mount Sinai or at the baptism of Jesus.<sup>9</sup>
		
			
		
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Special revelation includes all the words of Scripture but is not limited to the words of Scripture, for it also includes, for example, many words of Jesus that were not recorded in Scripture, and probably there were many words spoken by Old Testament prophets and New Testament apostles that were not recorded in Scripture either.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that all people know something of God&rsquo;s moral laws is a great blessing for society, for unless they did there would be no societal restraint on the evil that people would do and no restraint from their consciences. Because there is some common knowledge of right and wrong, Christians can often find much consensus with non-Christians in matters of civil law, community standards, basic ethics for business and professional activity, and acceptable patterns of conduct in ordinary life. Moreover, we can appeal to the sense of rightness within people&rsquo;s hearts (<a href="logosref:Bible.Ro2.14">Rom. 2:14</a>) when attempting to enact better laws or overturn bad laws, or to right some other injustices in society around us. The knowledge of God&rsquo;s existence and character also provides a basis of information that enables the gospel to make sense to a non-Christian&rsquo;s heart and mind: unbelievers know that God exists and that they have broken his standards, so the news that Christ died to pay for their sins should truly come as <span style="font-style:italic;">good news</span> to them.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		However, it must be emphasized that Scripture nowhere indicates that people can know the gospel, or know the way of salvation, through such general revelation. They may know that God exists, that he is their Creator, that they owe him obedience, and that they have sinned against him. The existence of systems of sacrifice in primitive religions throughout history attests to the fact that these things can be clearly known by people apart from the Bible. The repeated occurrences of the &ldquo;rain and fruitful seasons&rdquo; mentioned in <a href="logosref:Bible.Ac14.17">Acts 14:17</a> may even lead some people to reason that God is not only holy and righteous but also loving and forgiving. But how the <span style="font-style:italic;">holiness and justice</span> of God can ever be reconciled with his <span style="font-style:italic;">willingness to forgive sins</span> is a mystery that has never been solved by any religion apart from the Bible. Nor does the Bible give us any hope that it ever can be discovered apart from specific revelation from God. It is the great wonder of our redemption that God himself has provided the way of salvation by sending his own Son, who is both God and man, to be our representative and bear the penalty for our sins, thus combining the justice and love of God in one infinitely wise and amazingly gracious act. This fact, which seems commonplace to the Christian ear, should not lose its wonder for us: it could never have been conceived by man alone apart from God&rsquo;s special, verbal revelation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:9pt; text-indent:18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Furthermore, even if an adherent of a primitive religion could think that God somehow <span style="font-style:italic;">must have</span> himself paid the penalty for our sins, such a thought would only be an extraordinary speculation. It could never be held with enough certainty <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 124  </span>to be the ground on which to rest saving faith unless God himself confirmed such speculation with his own words, namely, the words of the gospel proclaiming either that this indeed was going to happen (if the revelation came in the time before Christ) or that it indeed has happened (if the revelation came in the time after Christ). The Bible never views human speculation apart from the Word of God as a sufficient basis on which <span style="font-style:italic;">to rest saving faith</span>: such saving faith, according to Scripture, is always confidence or trust in God that rests on the truthfulness of God&rsquo;s own words.<sup>10</sup>

		Questions for Personal Application
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		1. When you are witnessing to an unbeliever, what is the one thing above all others that you should want him or her to read? Do you know of anyone who ever became a Christian without either reading the Bible or hearing someone tell him or her what the Bible said? What then is the primary task of an evangelistic missionary? How should the necessity of Scripture affect our missionary orientation?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		2. Do you nourish your soul on the spiritual food of the Word as carefully and diligently as you nourish your body on physical food? What makes us so spiritually insensitive that we feel physical hunger much more acutely than spiritual hunger? What is the remedy?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		3. When we are actively seeking to know God&rsquo;s will, where should we spend most of our time and effort? In practice, where do you spend most of your time and effort when seeking to find God&rsquo;s will? Do God&rsquo;s principles in Scripture and the apparent guidance we receive from feelings, conscience, advice, circumstances, human reasoning, or society ever seem to conflict? How should we seek to resolve the conflict?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:4.5pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		4. Is it a hopeless task to work for civil legislation based on standards that accord with God&rsquo;s moral principles in Scripture? Why is there good reason to hope that we will finally be able to persuade a great majority of our society to adopt laws consistent with scriptural norms? What would hinder this effort?

		An alternative hymn for this chapter is a modern Scripture song, &ldquo;Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God.&rdquo; The second verse of this song (&ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone …&rdquo;) is a quotation of <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt4.4">Matthew 4:4</a> and expresses the necessity of Scripture for maintaining our spiritual life: we live on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. The other verses of the song do not speak directly of the doctrine of the necessity of Scripture but do contain the words of gospel invitation (vv. <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt4.1">1</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt4.4">4</a>, <a href="logosref:Bible.Mt4.5">5</a>). All verses in the song are direct quotations of Scripture, and, as such, will be spiritually nourishing for us to sing and meditate on.

		<p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp; As the subsequent sections indicate, when this when this definition says that the Bible is necessary for certain things, I do not mean to imply that an actual printed copy of the Bible is necessary for every person, because sometimes people hear the Bible read aloud or hear others tell them some of the contents of the Bible. But even these oral communications of the contents of the Bible are based on the existence of written copies of the Bible to which other people have access.</p><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Someone might object that the following verse, <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro10.18">Rom. 10:18</a>, in its quotation of <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps19.4">Ps. 19:4</a>, &ldquo;Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world,&rdquo; implies that all people everywhere have already heard the gospel message or the message of Christ. But in the context of <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps19">Psalm 19</a>, verse <a href="logosref:Bible.Ps19.4">4</a> only speaks of the fact that the natural creation, especially the heavens above, proclaim God&rsquo;s glory and the greatness of his creative activity. There is no thought here of the proclamation of salvation through Christ. The idea that all people everywhere have heard the gospel of Christ through natural revelation would also be contrary to Paul&rsquo;s missionary activities.</p><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp; On the question of whether it is fair of God to condemn people who have never heard of Christ, see the discussion in chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.2.19.0.0.0.0.0">19</a>, pp. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.pp_402-403">402&ndash;3</a>, and chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.5.32.0.0.0.0.0">32</a>, pp. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.pp_682-683">682&ndash;83</a>.</p><p><sup>*</sup>&nbsp; See chapter <a href="logosres:grudemest;pos=R.3.24.0.0.0.0.0">24</a>, p. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.p_500">500</a>, on the question of salvation of infants who die in infancy.</p><p>NASB&nbsp; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">nasb</span>&mdash;New American Standard Bible</p><p>cf&nbsp; cf.&mdash;compare</p><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp; This statement assumes that we have become convinced that Scripture is indeed the very words of God, and that we have understood at least some portions of Scripture correctly. Yet at this point the doctrine of the clarity of Scripture discussed in the previous chapter assures us that we will be able to understand the teachings of Scripture correctly, and the overwhelming testimony of Scripture to its own divine authorship (discussed in the chapters above concerning different forms of the Word of God and concerning the authority of Scripture), made persuasive to us by the work of the Holy Spirit, convinces us of the divine authorship of Scripture. In this sense the argument becomes not so much circular as something like a spiral where each section of the doctrine of Scripture reinforces the other and deepens our persuasion of the truthfulness of other sections of the doctrine of Scripture. By this process, our persuasion that Scripture is God&rsquo;s Word, that it is truth, that it is clear, and that knowledge which we attain from it is certain, becomes stronger and stronger the more we study and reflect on it.We can of course speak of degrees of certainty that we might have concerning the fact that the Bible is God&rsquo;s Word, and degrees of certainty that our interpretation of any one teaching in Scripture is correct. Then from the standpoint of individual personal experience, we could say that our certainty of the correctness of knowledge that we have from Scripture becomes greater in proportion to our certainty about the God-breathed character and clarity of Scripture.Yet from a theological standpoint, if we begin with an agreement that Scripture is God-breathed and that we do understand its teachings (at least its major teachings) correctly, then it is appropriate to say that the knowledge we attain from Scripture is more certain than any other knowledge we have.</p><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp; See pp. <a href="logosres:grudemest;ref=Page.pp_122-123">122&ndash;23</a> for definitions of general revelation and special revelation.</p><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp; The Swiss theologian Karl Barth (1886&ndash;1968) denied that natural man can know anything of God through the general revelation found in nature, but insisted that knowledge of God can only come through a knowledge of God&rsquo;s grace in Christ. His radical rejection of natural revelation has not gained wide acceptance; it rests upon the unlikely view that <a href="logosref:Bible.Ro1.21">Rom. 1:21</a> refers to a knowledge of God in theory but not in fact.</p><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp; The consciences of unbelievers will be suppressed or hardened in various areas of morality, depending on cultural influences and personal circumstances. A cannibalistic society, for example, will have many members whose consciences are hardened and insensitive with regard to the evil of murder, while modern American society, for example, exhibits very little sensitivity of conscience with regard to the evil of falsehood in speech, or disrespect for parental authority, or sexual immorality. Moreover, individuals who repeatedly commit a certain sin will often find the pangs of conscience diminishing after time: a thief may feel very guilty after his first or second robbery but feel little guilt after his twentieth. The witness of conscience is still there in each case, but it is suppressed through repeated wickedness.</p><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp; For an extensive discussion of the history of the doctrine of general revelation and its basis in Scripture, see Bruce Demarest, <span style="font-style:italic;">General Revelation</span> (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982); see also the excellent treatment of this doctrine in Gordon R.

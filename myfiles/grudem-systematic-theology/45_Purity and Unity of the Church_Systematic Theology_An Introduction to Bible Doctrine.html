	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the previous chapter we saw that there are &ldquo;true churches&rdquo; and &ldquo;false churches.&rdquo; In this chapter a further distinction must be made: there are <span style="font-style:italic;">more pure</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">less pure</span> churches.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This fact is evident from a brief comparison of Paul&rsquo;s epistles. When we look at Philippians or 1 Thessalonians we find evidence of Paul&rsquo;s great joy in these churches and the relative absence of major doctrinal or moral problems (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.3-11">Phil. 1:3&ndash;11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php4.10-16">4:10&ndash;16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th1.2-10">1 Thess. 1:2&ndash;10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th3.6-10">3:6&ndash;10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Th1.3-4">2 Thess. 1:3&ndash;4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Th2.13">2:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co8.1-5">2 Cor. 8:1&ndash;5</a>). On the other hand, there were all sorts of serious doctrinal and moral problems in the churches of Galatia (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.6-9">Gal. 1:6&ndash;9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.1-5">3:1&ndash;5</a>) and Corinth (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.1-4">1 Cor. 3:1&ndash;4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.18-21">4:18&ndash;21</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.1-2">5:1&ndash;2</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.6">6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.1-8">6:1&ndash;8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.17-22">11:17&ndash;22</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.20-23">14:20&ndash;23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.12">15:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co1.23-2.11">2 Cor. 1:23&ndash;2:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.3-5">11:3&ndash;5</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.12-15">12&ndash;15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.20-13.10">12:20&ndash;13:10</a>). Other examples could be given, but it should be clear that among true churches there are <span style="font-style:italic;">less pure</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">more pure</span> churches. This may be represented as in figure <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.45.1.1.1.0.0%3aFIG.45.1">45.1</a>.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Definitions of Purity and Unity</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define the purity of the church as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">The purity of the church is its degree of freedom from wrong doctrine and conduct, and its degree of conformity to God&rsquo;s revealed will for the church</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As we shall see in the following discussion, it is right to pray and work for the greater purity of the church. But purity cannot be our only concern, or Christians <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 874  </span>would have a tendency to separate into tiny groups of very &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Christians and tend to exclude anyone who showed the slightest deviation in doctrine or conduct of life. Therefore the New Testament also speaks frequently about the need to strive for the <span style="font-style:italic;">unity</span> of the visible church. This may be defined in the following way: <span style="font-style:italic;">The unity of the church is its degree of freedom from divisions among true Christians</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The definition specifies &ldquo;true Christians&rdquo; because, as we saw in the previous chapter, there are those who are Christian in name only, but have had no genuine experience of regeneration by the Holy Spirit. Nonetheless, many of these people take the name &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and many churches that are filled with such unbelievers still call themselves Christian churches. We should not expect or work for organizational or functional unity that includes all of those people, and therefore there will never be unity with all churches that call themselves &ldquo;Christian.&rdquo; But, as we shall also see in the following discussion, the New Testament certainly encourages us to work for the unity of all true believers.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. Signs of a More Pure Church</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Factors that make a church &ldquo;more pure&rdquo; include:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. Biblical doctrine (or right preaching of the Word)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. Proper use of the sacraments (or ordinances)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Right use of church discipline
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. Genuine worship
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. Effective prayer
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 6. Effective witness
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 7. Effective fellowship
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 8. Biblical church government
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 9. Spiritual power in ministry
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 10. Personal holiness of life among members
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 11. Care for the poor
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 12. Love for Christ
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There may be other signs than these, but at least these can be mentioned as factors that increase a church&rsquo;s conformity to God&rsquo;s purposes. Of course, churches can be more pure in some areas and less pure in others&mdash;a church may have excellent doctrine and sound preaching, for example, yet be a dismal failure in witness to others or in meaningful worship. Or a church may have a dynamic witness and very God-honoring times of worship but be weak in doctrinal understanding and Bible teaching.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Most churches will tend to think that the areas in which they are strong are the most important areas, and the areas where they are weak are less important. But the New Testament encourages us to work for the purity of the church in all of these areas. Christ&rsquo;s goal for the church is &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">that he might sanctify her</span> having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, <span style="font-style:italic;">that he might present the church to himself</span> in splendor, <span style="font-style:italic;">without spot or wrinkle or any such thing</span> that she might be holy and without blemish&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.26-27">Eph. 5:26&ndash;27</a>). Paul&rsquo;s ministry was one of &ldquo;warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man mature in Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.28">Col. 1:28</a>). Moreover, Paul told Titus that elders must &ldquo;be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 875  </span>contradict it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.9">Titus 1:9</a>), and he said that false teachers &ldquo;must be silenced&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.11">Titus 1:11</a>). Jude urged Christians to &ldquo;contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jud3">Jude 3</a>). Proper use of the sacraments is commanded in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.17-34">1 Corinthians 11:17&ndash;34</a>, and right use of church discipline to protect the purity of the church is required in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.6-7">1 Corinthians 5:6&ndash;7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.12-13">12&ndash;13</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament also mentions a number of other factors: we are to strive for spiritual worship (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.18-20">Eph. 5:18&ndash;20</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.16-17">Col. 3:16&ndash;17</a>), effective witness (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.19-20">Matt. 28:19&ndash;20</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.34-35">John 13:34&ndash;35</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.44-47">Acts 2:44&ndash;47</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.7">1 John 4:7</a>), proper government of the church (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.1-13">1 Tim. 3:1&ndash;13</a>), spiritual power in ministry (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.8">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.16">Rom. 1:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.20">1 Cor. 4:20</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co10.3-4">2 Cor. 10:3&ndash;4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.3-5">Gal. 3:3&ndash;5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti3.5">2 Tim. 3:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.16">James 5:16</a>), personal holiness (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.3">1 Thess. 4:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.14">Heb. 12:14</a>), care for the poor (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.32-35">Acts 4:32&ndash;35</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.26">Rom. 15:26</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.10">Gal. 2:10</a>), and love for Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.8">1 Peter 1:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.4">Rev. 2:4</a>). In fact, all Christians are to &ldquo;strive to excel in <span style="font-style:italic;">building up the church</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.12">1 Cor. 14:12</a>), an exhortation that applies not only to an increase in the number of church members, but also (and in fact primarily) to the &ldquo;edification&rdquo; or growth of the church toward Christian maturity. The force of all of these passages is to remind us that <span style="font-style:italic;">we are to work for the purity of the visible church</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Of course, if we are to work for the purity of the church, especially of the local church of which we are a part, we must recognize that this is a process, and that any church of which we are a part will be somewhat impure in various areas. There were no perfect churches at the time of the New Testament and there will be no perfect churches until Christ returns. This means that Christians have no obligation to seek the <span style="font-style:italic;">purest church</span> they can find and stay there, and then leave it if an even purer church comes to their attention. Rather, they should find a <span style="font-style:italic;">true church</span> in which they can have effective ministry and in which they will experience Christian growth as well, and then should stay there and minister, continually working for the purity of that church. God will often bless their prayers and faithful witness and the church will gradually grow in many areas of purity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But we must realize that not all churches will respond well to influences that would bring them to greater purity. Sometimes, in spite of a few faithful Christians within a church, its dominant direction will be set by others who are determined to lead it on another course. Unless God graciously intervenes to bring reformation, some of these churches will become cults, and others will just die and close their doors. But more commonly these churches will simply drift into liberal Protestantism.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is helpful at this point to remember that classical liberal Protestantism is humanistic, and its approaches are <span style="font-style:italic;">primarily man-centered</span> rather than God-centered. When a church begins to stray from faithfulness to Christ, this will be evident not only in the shift to impure doctrine (which can sometimes be concealed from church members by the use of evasive language) but also in the daily life of the church: its activities, its preaching, its counseling, and even the casual conversations among members will tend to become more and more man-centered and less and less God-centered. There will tend to be a repeated emphasis on the typical kinds of self-help advice given in popular journals and by secular <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 876  </span>psychologists. There will be a horizontal orientation as opposed to a vertical or God-centered orientation, there will be fewer and fewer extended times of prayer and less and less emphasis on the direct application of Scripture to daily situations, but more emphasis on simply being a caring and sensitive person, and on affirming others and acting in love toward them. The conversation and activities of the church will have very little genuine spiritual content&mdash;little emphasis on the need for daily prayer for individual concerns and for forgiveness of sins, little emphasis on daily personal reading of Scripture, and little emphasis on moment-by-moment trust in Christ and knowing the reality of his presence in our lives. Where there are admonitions to moral reformation, these will often be viewed as human deficiencies that people can correct by their own discipline and effort, and perhaps encouragement from others, but these moral aspects of life will not primarily be viewed as sin against a holy God, sin which can only effectively be overcome by the power of the Holy Spirit working within. When such humanistic emphases become dominant in a church, it has moved far toward the &ldquo;less-pure&rdquo; end of the scale in many of the areas listed above, and it is moving in the direction of becoming a false church.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. New Testament Teaching on the Unity of the Church</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There is a strong emphasis in the New Testament on the unity of the church. Jesus&rsquo; goal is that &ldquo;there shall be <span style="font-style:italic;">one flock, one shepherd</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.16">John 10:16</a>), and he prays for all future believers &ldquo;that they may all be one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.21">John 17:21</a>). This unity will be a witness to unbelievers, for Jesus prays &ldquo;that they may become <span style="font-style:italic;">perfectly one, so that the world may know that you have sent me</span> and have loved them even as you have loved me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.23">John 17:23</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul reminds the Corinthians that they are &ldquo;called to be saints <span style="font-style:italic;">together with all those who in every place call on the name of our </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Lord Jesus Christ</span> both their Lord and ours&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.2">1 Cor. 1:2</a>). Then Paul writes to Corinth, &ldquo;I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that <span style="font-style:italic;">all of you agree</span> and that there be no dissensions among you, but <span style="font-style:italic;">that you be united</span> in the same mind and the same judgment&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.10">1 Cor. 1:10</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.13">13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		He encourages the Philippians, &ldquo;complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, <span style="font-style:italic;">being in full accord and of one mind</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.2">Phil. 2:2</a>). He tells the Ephesians that Christians are to be &ldquo;eager to maintain the <span style="font-style:italic;">unity</span> of the Spirit in the bond of peace&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.3">Eph. 4:3</a>), and that the Lord gives gifts to the church &ldquo;for building up the body of Christ, <span style="font-style:italic;">until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God</span> to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.12-13">Eph. 4:12&ndash;13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul can <span style="font-style:italic;">command</span> the church to live in unity because there already is an <span style="font-style:italic;">actual</span> spiritual unity in Christ which exists among genuine believers. He says, &ldquo;There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all, who is above all and through all and in all&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.4-6">Eph. 4:4&ndash;6</a>). And though the body of Christ consists of many members, those members are all &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">one body</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.17">1 Cor. 10:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.12-26">12:12&ndash;26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because they are jealous to protect this unity of the church, the New Testament writers give strong warnings against those who cause divisions:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 877  </span>I appeal to you, brethren, to take note of those who create dissensions and difficulties, in opposition to the doctrine which you have been taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.17-18">Rom. 16:17&ndash;18</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul opposed Peter to his face because he separated from Gentile Christians and began eating only with Jewish Christians (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.11-14">Gal. 2:11&ndash;14</a>). Those who promote &ldquo;strife … dissension, party spirit … shall not inherit the kingdom of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.20-21">Gal. 5:20&ndash;21</a>). And Jude warns that those who &ldquo;set up divisions&rdquo; are &ldquo;worldly people, devoid of the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jud19">Jude 19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Consistent with this New Testament emphasis on the unity of believers is the fact that the direct commands to <span style="font-style:italic;">separate</span> from other people are always commands to separate <span style="font-style:italic;">from unbelievers</span> not from Christians with whom one disagrees. When Paul says, &ldquo;Therefore come out from them, and <span style="font-style:italic;">be separate from them</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co6.17">2 Cor. 6:17</a>), it is in support of his opening command of that section, &ldquo;Do not be mismated <span style="font-style:italic;">with unbelievers</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co6.14">2 Cor. 6:14</a>). And Paul tells Timothy that he is to &ldquo;avoid such people&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti3.5">2 Tim. 3:5</a>), referring not to believers but to unbelievers, those who are &ldquo;lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding the form of religion but denying the power of it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti3.4-5">2 Tim. 3:4&ndash;5</a>). He says that these people are &ldquo;men of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti3.8">2 Tim. 3:8</a>). Of course, there is a kind of church discipline that requires separation from an individual who is causing trouble within the church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.17">Matt. 18:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.11-13">1 Cor. 5:11&ndash;13</a>), and there may be other reasons for which Christians conclude that separation is required, but it is important to note here, in discussing the unity of the church, that there are no direct New Testament commands to separate from Christians with whom one has doctrinal differences (unless those differences involve such serious heresy that the Christian faith itself is denied).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These passages on church unity tell us that, in addition to working for the purity of the visible church, <span style="font-style:italic;">we are also to work for the unity of the visible church</span>. Yet we must realize that such unity does not actually require one worldwide church government over all Christians. In fact, the unity of believers is often demonstrated quite effectively through voluntary cooperation and affiliation among Christian groups. Moreover, different types of ministries and different emphases in ministry may result in different organizations, all under the universal headship of Christ as Lord of the church. Therefore the existence of different denominations, mission boards, Christian educational institutions, college ministries, and so forth is not necessarily a mark of disunity of the church (though in some cases it may be), for there may be a great deal of cooperation and frequent demonstrations of unity among such diverse bodies as these. (I think the modern term <span style="font-style:italic;">parachurch organization</span> is unfortunate, because it implies that these organizations are somehow &ldquo;beside&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;outside of&rdquo; the church, whereas in reality they are simply different parts of the one universal church.) Moreover, many Christians argue that there <span style="font-style:italic;">should not</span> be a worldwide government of the church, because the New Testament pattern of church government never shows elders having authority over any more than their own local congregations (see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.47.0.0.0.0.0">47</a> <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 878  </span>below). In fact, even in the New Testament the apostles agreed that Paul should emphasize missionary work to the Gentiles while Peter would emphasize missionary work to the Jews (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.7">Gal. 2:7</a>), and Paul and Barnabas went their separate ways for a time because of a disagreement over whether they should take Mark with them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac15.39-40">Acts 15:39&ndash;40</a>), though certainly they had unity in every other way.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">E. Brief History of Organizational Separation in the Church</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There are sometimes reasons why the outward or visible unity of the church cannot be maintained. A brief survey of the history of organizational separation in the church may highlight some of these reasons, and help explain where present-day denominational divisions came from.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		During the first thousand years of the church there was for the most part outward unity. There had been some minor divisions during controversies with groups like the Montanists (second century) and the Donatists (fourth century), and there was a minor separation by some Monophysite churches (fifth and sixth centuries), but the prevailing sentiment was one of strong opposition to division in the body of Christ. For example, Irenaeus, a second century bishop, said about those who cause divisions in the church, &ldquo;No reformation able to be effected by them will be of great enough importance to compensate for the damage arising from their schism&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Irenaeus.Adv._Haer._4.33.7"><span style="font-style:italic;">Against Heresies</span></a><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Irenaeus.Adv._Haer._4.33.7"> 4.33.7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The first major division in the church came in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1054 when the Eastern (now Orthodox) church separated from the Western (Roman Catholic) church. The reason was that the pope had changed a church creed simply on his own authority, and the Eastern church protested that he had no right to do that.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Reformation in the sixteenth century then separated the Western church into Roman Catholic and Protestant branches, yet there was often a strong reluctance to cause formal division. Martin Luther wanted to reform the church without dividing it, but he was excommunicated in 1521. The Anglican (Episcopalian) church did not separate from Rome, but was excommunicated in 1570; thus it can say, &ldquo;We suffer schism, we did not cause it.&rdquo; On the other hand, there were many Protestants, especially among the Anabaptists, who wanted to form churches of believers only, and began as early as 1525 to form separate churches in Switzerland and then other parts of Europe.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the centuries following the Reformation, Protestantism splintered into hundreds of smaller groups. Sometimes leaders of the new groups regretted such divisions: John Wesley, although he was the founder of Methodism, claimed that he lived and died a member of the Anglican church. It was often the case that matters of conscience or religious freedom forced the division, as with the Puritans <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 879  </span>and many Pietist groups. On the other hand, sometimes language differences among immigrant groups in America led to the founding of separate churches.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Have the reasons for separation into different organizations and denominations always been proper ones? Although there have almost always been strong theological differences in major church divisions, one fears that too often, especially in more recent history, the real motives for beginning or maintaining separation have been selfish ones, and that John Calvin may have been correct in saying, &ldquo;Pride or self-glorification is the cause and starting point of all controversies, when each person, claiming for himself more than he is entitled to have, is eager to have others in his power.&rdquo; Moreover, he says, &ldquo;Ambition has been, and still is, the mother of all errors, of all disturbances and sects.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the mid-twentieth century the ecumenical movement sought greater organizational unity among denominations, but without noteworthy success. It by no means received wholehearted approval or support from evangelicals. On the other hand, since the 1960s, the growth of the charismatic movement across almost all denominational lines, the rise of neighborhood Bible study and prayer groups, and a (regrettable) diminished doctrinal awareness among lay people, have brought about a remarkable increase in actual unity of fellowship&mdash;even between Protestants and Catholics&mdash;at the local level.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although the previous paragraphs spoke of separation in the sense of (1) the formation of <span style="font-style:italic;">separate organizations</span> there are two other, more severe kinds of separation that should be mentioned: (2) &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">No cooperation</span>&rdquo;: in this case a church or Christian organization refuses to cooperate in joint activities with other churches (activities such as evangelistic campaigns or joint worship services or mutual recognition of ordination). (3) &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">No personal fellowship</span>&rdquo;: this involves the extremely strict avoidance of all personal fellowship with members of another church, and prohibits any joint prayer or Bible study, and sometimes even ordinary social contact, with members of another church group. We will discuss the possible reasons for these kinds of separation in the following section.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">F. Reasons for Separation</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As we examine the motives people have had for church separation throughout history, and as we compare those motives with the New Testament requirements that we seek both the unity and the purity of the visible church, we can find <span style="font-style:italic;">both right and wrong reasons for separation</span>. Wrong reasons would include such things as personal ambition and pride, or differences on minor doctrines or practices (doctrinal or behavioral patterns that would not affect any other doctrine and that would not have a significant effect on the way one lives the Christian life).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, there are some reasons for separation that we may consider to be right (or possibly right, depending on the specific circumstances). In most cases these reasons will flow from the need to work for the purity of the church as well as its unity. These reasons for separation can be considered in three categories: <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.45.1.6.1.0.0">(1) doctrinal reasons</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.45.1.6.2.0.0">(2) reasons of conscience</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.45.1.6.3.0.0">(3) practical considerations</a>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 880  </span>In the following section, I have listed some situations where it seems to me that Christians would be <span style="font-style:italic;">required</span> to leave a church. Then I have listed some other situations that seem to me less clear, in which some Christians may think it <span style="font-style:italic;">wise</span> to leave a church, and others will think it <span style="font-style:italic;">unwise</span>. In these less-clear cases, I have generally not drawn any conclusions, but simply listed the kinds of factors that Christians will want to consider.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Doctrinal Reasons</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> A need for separation may arise when the doctrinal position of a church deviates from biblical standards in a serious way. This deviation may be in official statements or in actual belief and practice, insofar as that can be determined. But when does doctrinal deviation become so serious that it requires withdrawing from a church or forming a separate church? As we noted above, there are no commands in the New Testament to separate from any true church, so long as it is still a part of the body of Christ. Paul&rsquo;s response even to people in erring churches (even in churches like the one at Corinth, which tolerated serious doctrinal and moral error, and for a time tolerated some who rejected Paul&rsquo;s apostolic authority) is not to tell faithful Christians to separate from those churches, but to admonish the churches, work for their repentance, and pray for them. Of course there are commands to discipline those who cause trouble within the church, sometimes by excluding them from church fellowship (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.11-13">1 Cor. 5:11&ndash;13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Th3.14-15">2 Thess. 3:14&ndash;15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt3.10-11">Titus 3:10&ndash;11</a>), but there are no instructions to leave the church and cause division if this cannot be done immediately (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.14-16">Rev. 2:14&ndash;16</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.20-25">20&ndash;25</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk9.50">Luke 9:50</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk11.23">11:23</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/2Jn10-11">2 John 10&ndash;11</a>, which forbids the receiving of false teachers, makes perhaps the strongest statement in the entire New Testament: &ldquo;Do not take him into your house or welcome him. Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work&rdquo; (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">niv</span>). But it should be noted that such a visitor is teaching a serious heresy about the person of Christ, one that prevents people from having saving faith. (John is talking about anyone who &ldquo;does not abide in the doctrine of Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;does not have God&rdquo; [v. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Jn9">9</a>].) Moreover, this verse refers to false teachers, not to all individuals who hold false beliefs, because it speaks of someone who comes to you and &ldquo;does not bring this doctrine&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Jn10">10</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Jn7">7</a>, &ldquo;Many deceivers have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh&rdquo;). John even uses the word <span style="font-style:italic;">antichrist</span> for such teachers. Finally, the greeting John has in mind refers either to an official church greeting or one that would give an appearance of endorsement of this doctrine, because the prohibition talks about someone who &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">comes to you</span> and does not <span style="font-style:italic;">bring this doctrine</span>&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Jn10">10</a>), which suggests that the person in view is a traveling teacher who comes not to an individual home but to address the church as a whole.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the principle of separation from unbelievers or from fundamental error that would involve the denial of the Christian faith, Christians would seem to be <span style="font-style:italic;">required</span> on doctrinal grounds to withdraw from a church and join or form a new organization only when the doctrinal error is so serious and so pervasive that the parent church <span style="font-style:italic;">has become a false church</span> no longer part of the body of Christ. This would be a church which is no longer a fellowship of true believers, no longer a <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 881  </span>true part of the body of Christ, or no longer a place where those who believe its teachings will find salvation. In the case of leaving a false church, those who separate will claim that in fact they have not <span style="font-style:italic;">left</span> the true church, but that they <span style="font-style:italic;">are</span> the true church, and that the parent organization has left by means of its error. In fact, both Luther and Calvin eventually said that the Roman Catholic Church was not a true church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, even when withdrawal or separation is not absolutely required, many Christians may find that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">wise</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">expedient</span> to withdraw before the church has become a false church, but when serious doctrinal deviation occurs. For instance, some would argue that doctrinal deviation has become intolerable whenever heretical views on major doctrines (such as the Trinity, the person of Christ, the atonement, the resurrection, etc.) can be advocated by a church leader without causing him to be subject to church discipline or to exclusion from the fellowship of the church. In other cases many would say that separation should occur when the church as a body publicly approves of some serious doctrinal or moral error (such as endorsing a doctrinal error in a church creed or statement of faith). However, other Christians would not think separation to be wise or expedient in such cases, but would advocate praying and working for revival and reformation within the church, and giving clear public statements of disagreement with any doctrinal error that has been tolerated. In such cases, those who decide to stay and those who decide they must leave should both recognize that God may call different Christians to different roles and ministries, and therefore to different decisions, and we would do well to give considerable freedom to others to seek God&rsquo;s wisdom in such a case and to obey it as they best understand it for their own lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Matters of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Conscience</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In the area of conscience, if a Christian had no freedom to preach or teach as his or her conscience, informed by Scripture, would dictate, it might be thought that separation was necessary or at least wise. But caution and great humility are in order here: individual judgment may be distorted, especially if it is not informed by the consensus of faithful believers throughout history, and by the counsel of believers in the present.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, the command in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co6.14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a> not to be yoked together with unbelievers could also require a person to separate if the parent church became so dominated by those who gave no evidence of saving faith that such &ldquo;yoking together&rdquo; could not be avoided. In this passage the prohibition against being &ldquo;yoked together&rdquo; with unbelievers forbids not mere association or even acceptance of help (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk9.50">Luke 9:50</a>, but also <a href="https://ref.ly/3Jn7">3 John 7</a>), but rather <span style="font-style:italic;">the giving up of control over one&rsquo;s activities and the loss of freedom to act in obedience to God</span> for these restraints are what is implied in the metaphor of being &ldquo;yoked&rdquo; together. Some people might also find it necessary or at least wise to leave a church on the basis of conscience if staying implied approval of some unbiblical doctrine or practice within the church, and thereby encouraged others to follow that wrong doctrine or practice. <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 882  </span>But others may think it right to stay in the church and voice clear disapproval of the faulty doctrine.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In other cases, some have argued that it is required to leave a denomination when a higher governing authority in that denomination, which one has promised to obey, commands an action which is clearly sinful (that is, an action which is clearly contrary to Scripture). In such a case some would say that leaving the denomination is the only way to avoid doing either the sinful act which is commanded or the sinful act of disobedience to those in authority. But this does not seem to be a necessary requirement, for many Scripture passages could be cited showing that disobedience to a higher authority is not wrong when one is commanded to sin (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.29">Acts 5:29</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Da3.18">Dan. 3:18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Da6.10">6:10</a>), and that one may disobey but remain in the parent church until forced out.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Practical Considerations</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Christians may decide to separate from a parent church if, after prayerful consideration, it seems that staying in the parent church will very likely result in more harm than good. This could be because their work for the Lord would become frustrated and ineffectual due to opposition to it from within the parent church, or because they would find little or no fellowship with others in that church. Moreover, some may decide that staying in the church would harm the faith of other believers or would hinder unbelievers from coming to true faith because their continued affiliation with the parent church would seem to imply approval of false teachings within that church. Again, Christians might find themselves in situations where they have prayed and worked for change for some time but there seems to be no reasonable hope for change in the parent church, perhaps because the present leadership group is resistant to correction from Scripture, is firmly entrenched, and is self-perpetuating. In all of these situations much prayer and mature judgment will be required, because withdrawing from a church, especially by people who have been there a long time or have established leadership functions in the church, is a serious action.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Are There Times When Cooperation and Personal Fellowship Are Prohibited?</span> Finally, when should Christians take stronger steps than those mentioned above and engage in the kind of separation that we earlier called &ldquo;no cooperation&rdquo; or &ldquo;no personal fellowship&rdquo;? The biblical passages we have looked at seem to require that Christians practice &ldquo;no cooperation&rdquo; in certain activities with another group only when the other group is an unbelieving one, and then, it seems, only when the unbelieving group shares control of the activity (this is implied in the metaphor of being &ldquo;yoked together&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co6.14">2 Cor. 6:14</a>). Of course, it may be found wise or expedient on other grounds to decide not to cooperate in a particular function, but non-cooperation would not seem to be required except when the other group is an unbelieving one. Certainly <span style="font-style:italic;">opposition</span> to activities such as evangelistic campaigns by other true believers would be seen by the New Testament authors as divisiveness and a failure to demonstrate the unity of the body of Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 883  </span>The third and most extreme kind of separation, the avoidance of all personal fellowship with members of another entire church group, is never commanded in the New Testament. Such an extreme measure of &ldquo;no fellowship&rdquo; is only implied in serious cases of church discipline of individuals, not in cases of differences with entire churches.

		This hymn speaks of the unity or the &ldquo;tie&rdquo; that binds the hearts of Christians together in love. It continues to speak of fellowship as like the fellowship of heaven: it is &ldquo;like to that above.&rdquo; It also speaks of sharing in prayer and concern for each other and bearing of one another&rsquo;s burdens. The hymn goes on to speak of our hope that we will one day be united in &ldquo;perfect love and friendship&rdquo; for eternity in heaven.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. What Are Angels?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define angels as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">Angels are created, spiritual beings with moral judgment and high intelligence, but without physical bodies</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Created Spiritual Beings</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Angels have not always existed; they are part of the universe that God created. In a passage that refers to angels as the &ldquo;host&rdquo; of heaven (or &ldquo;armies of heaven&rdquo;), Ezra says, &ldquo;You are the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, you alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, <span style="font-style:italic;">with all their host</span> … and the host of heaven worships you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ne9.6">Neh. 9:6</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps148.2">Ps. 148:2</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps148.5">5</a>). Paul tells us that God created all things &ldquo;visible and invisible&rdquo; through Christ and for him, and then specifically includes the angelic world with the phrase &ldquo;whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.16">Col. 1:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		That angels exercise moral judgement is seen in the fact that some of them sinned and fell from their positions (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud6">Jude 6</a>; see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.20.0.0.0.0.0">20</a>). Their high intelligence is seen throughout Scripture as they speak to people (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.5">Matt. 28:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.6-11">Acts 12:6&ndash;11</a>; et al.) and sing praise to God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.11">Rev. 4:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re5.11">5:11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Since angels are &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.14">Heb. 1:14</a>) or spiritual creatures, they do not ordinarily have physical bodies (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.39">Luke 24:39</a>). Therefore they cannot usually be seen by us unless God gives us a special ability to see them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Nu22.31">Num. 22:31</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki6.17">2 Kings 6:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk2.13">Luke 2:13</a>). In their ordinary activities of guarding and protecting us (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps34.7">Ps. 34:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps91.11">91:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.14">Heb. 1:14</a>), and joining with us in worship to God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.22">Heb. 12:22</a>), they are invisible. However, from time to time angels took on a bodily form to appear to various people in Scripture (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.5">Matt. 28:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.2">Heb. 13:2</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Other Names for Angels</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture sometimes uses other terms for angels, such as &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job1.6">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Job2.1">2:1</a>), &ldquo;holy ones&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps89.5">Ps. 89:5</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps89.7">7</a>), &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.14">Heb. 1:14</a>), &ldquo;watchers&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da4.13">Dan. 4:13</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Da4.17">17</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Da4.23">23</a>), &ldquo;thrones,&rdquo; &ldquo;dominions,&rdquo; &ldquo;principalities,&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.16">Col. 1:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 398  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Other Kinds of Heavenly Beings</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> There are three other specific types of heavenly beings named in Scripture. Whether we think of these as special types of &ldquo;angels&rdquo; (in a broad sense of the term), or whether we think of them as heavenly beings distinct from angels, they are nonetheless created spiritual beings who serve and worship God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. The &ldquo;Cherubim&rdquo;</span> The cherubim were given the task of guarding the entrance to the Garden of Eden (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.24">Gen. 3:24</a>), and God himself is frequently said to be enthroned on the cherubim or to travel with the cherubim as his chariot (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps18.10">Ps. 18:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eze10.1-22">Ezek. 10:1&ndash;22</a>). Over the ark of the covenant in the Old Testament were two golden figures of cherubim with their wings stretched out above the ark, and it was there that God promised to come to dwell among his people: &ldquo;There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are upon the ark of testimony, I will speak with you of all that I will give you in commandment for the people of Israel&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex25.22">Ex. 25:22</a>; cf. vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex25.18-21">18&ndash;21</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. The &ldquo;Seraphim&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Another group of heavenly beings, the seraphim, are mentioned only in <a href="https://ref.ly/Is6.2-7">Isaiah 6:2&ndash;7</a>, where they continually worship the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> and call to one another, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is6.3">Isa. 6:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. The Living Creatures</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Both Ezekiel and Revelation tell us of yet other kinds of heavenly beings known as &ldquo;living creatures&rdquo; around God&rsquo;s throne (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eze1.5-14">Ezek. 1:5&ndash;14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.6-8">Rev. 4:6&ndash;8</a>). With their appearances like a lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle, they are the mightiest representatives of various parts of God&rsquo;s entire creation (wild beasts, domesticated animals, human beings, and birds), and they worship God continually: &ldquo;Day and night they never cease to sing, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.8">Rev. 4:8</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Rank and Order Among the Angels</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture indicates that there is rank and order among the angels. One angel, Michael, is called an &ldquo;archangel&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud9">Jude 9</a>, a title that indicates rule or authority over other angels. He is called &ldquo;one of the chief princes&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Da10.13">Daniel 10:13</a>. Michael also appears to be a leader in the angelic army: &ldquo;Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.7-8">Rev. 12:7&ndash;8</a>). And Paul tells us that the Lord will return from heaven &ldquo;with the archangel&rsquo;s call&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.16">1 Thess. 4:16</a>). Whether this refers to Michael as the only archangel, or whether there are other archangels, Scripture does not tell us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Names of Specific Angels</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Only two angels are specifically named in Scripture. Michael is mentioned in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud9">Jude 9</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.7-8">Revelation 12:7&ndash;8</a> as well as in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 399  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Da10.13">Daniel 10:13</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Da10.21">21</a>, where he is called &ldquo;Michael, one of the chief princes&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Da10.13">13</a>). The angel Gabriel is mentioned in <a href="https://ref.ly/Da8.16">Daniel 8:16</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Da9.21">9:21</a> as a messenger who comes from God to speak to Daniel. Gabriel is also identified as God&rsquo;s messenger to Zechariah and Mary in <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1">Luke 1</a>: the angel answers Zechariah, &ldquo;I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.19">Luke 1:19</a>). Then we read, &ldquo;In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin … and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.26-27">Luke 1:26&ndash;27</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. Only One Place at One Time</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture frequently represents angels as traveling from one place to another, as in the verse mentioned above where Gabriel &ldquo;was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.26">Luke 1:26</a>). This is made explicit when an angel comes to Daniel and says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		I have come because of your words. The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, so I left him there with the prince of the kingdom of Persia and came to make you understand what is to befall your people in the latter days. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da10.12-14">Dan. 10:12&ndash;14</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The idea that an angel can be in only one place at one time is consistent with the fact that angels are created beings. Unlike God, who is omnipresent, they are finite creatures and therefore limited to being in one place at one time, as is everything else that God has created.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">7. How Many Angels Are There?</span> Though Scripture does not give us a figure for the number of angels God created, it is apparently a very great number. We read that God on Mount Sinai &ldquo;came from the <span style="font-style:italic;">ten thousands of holy ones</span> with flaming fire at his right hand&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt33.2">Deut. 33:2</a>). We also learn that, &ldquo;the chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps68.17">Ps. 68:17</a> NIV). When we come to worship we come into the presence of &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">innumerable</span> angels&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.22">Heb. 12:22</a>). Their number is even more strikingly emphasized in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re5.11">Revelation 5:11</a>, where John says, &ldquo;I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering <span style="font-style:italic;">myriads of myriads</span> and thousands of thousands.&rdquo; This expression indicates an amazingly large number (from a human standpoint)&mdash;an innumerable assembly of angelic beings praising God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">8. Do People Have Individual Guardian Angels?</span> Scripture clearly tells us that God sends angels for our protection: &ldquo;He will give his angels charge of you to guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps91.11-12">Ps. 91:11&ndash;12</a>). But some people have gone beyond this idea of general protection and wondered if God gives a specific &ldquo;guardian <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 400  </span>angel&rdquo; for each individual in the world, or at least for each Christian. Support for this idea has been found in Jesus&rsquo; words about little children, &ldquo;in heaven <span style="font-style:italic;">their angels</span> always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.10">Matt. 18:10</a>). However, our Lord may simply be saying that angels who are assigned the task of protecting little children have ready access to God&rsquo;s presence. (To use an athletic analogy, the angels may be playing &ldquo;zone&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;man-on-man&rdquo; defense.) When the disciples in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.15">Acts 12:15</a> say that Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;angel&rdquo; must be knocking at the door, this does not necessarily imply belief in an individual guardian angel. It could be that an angel was guarding or caring for Peter just at that time. There seems to be, therefore, no convincing support for the idea of individual &ldquo;guardian angels&rdquo; in the text of Scripture.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">9. Angels Do Not Marry</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Jesus taught that in the resurrection people &ldquo;neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt22.30">Matt. 22:30</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk20.34-36">Luke 20:34&ndash;36</a>). This would suggest that angels do not have the kind of family relationships that exist among human beings. Scripture is otherwise silent on this point, so it is wise not to attempt to engage in speculation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">10. The Power of Angels</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Angels apparently have very great power. They are called &ldquo;you mighty ones who do his word&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.20">Ps. 103:20</a>) and &ldquo;powers&rdquo; (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.21">Eph. 1:21</a>) and &ldquo;dominions&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.16">Col. 1:16</a>). Angels are seemingly &ldquo;greater in might and power&rdquo; than rebellious human beings (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.11">2 Peter 2:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.2">Matt. 28:2</a>). At least for the time of their earthly existence, human beings are <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 401  </span>made &ldquo;lower than the angels&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.7">Heb. 2:7</a>). Though the power of angels is great, it is certainly not infinite, but it is used to battle against the evil demonic powers under the control of Satan (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da10.13">Dan. 10:13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.7-8">Rev. 12:7&ndash;8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.1-3">20:1&ndash;3</a>). Nonetheless, when the Lord returns, we will be raised to a position higher than that of angels (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.3">1 Cor. 6:3</a>; see section <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.19.1.3.1.0.0">C.1</a>, below).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">11. Who Is the Angel of the Lord?</span> Several passages of Scripture, especially in the Old Testament, speak of the angel of the Lord in a way that suggests that he is God himself taking on a human form to appear briefly to various people in the Old Testament.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In some passages &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> angel of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; (not &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">an</span> angel of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo;) is spoken of as the Lord himself. So &ldquo;the angel of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; who found Hagar in the wilderness promises her, &ldquo;I will so greatly multiply your descendants that they cannot be numbered for multitude&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge16.10">Gen. 16:10</a>), and Hagar responds by calling &ldquo;the name of <span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> who spoke to her</span> &ldquo;You are a God of seeing&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge16.13">Gen. 16:13</a>). Similarly, when Abraham is about to sacrifice his son Isaac, &ldquo;the angel of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; calls to him from heaven and says, &ldquo;Now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, <span style="font-style:italic;">from me</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge22.12">Gen. 22:12</a>). When &ldquo;the angel of God&rdquo; appeared to Jacob in a dream, he said, &ldquo;I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge31.11">Gen. 31:11</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge31.13">13</a>). Again, when &ldquo;the angel of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; appeared to Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush, he then said, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I am the God of your father</span> the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex3.2">Ex. 3:2</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex3.6">6</a>). These are clear instances of the angel of the Lord or the angel of God appearing as God himself, perhaps more specifically as God the Son taking on a human body for a short time in order to appear to human beings.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At other times the angel of the Lord seems to be distinguished from God (see <a href="https://ref.ly/2Sa24.16">2 Sam. 24:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps34.7">Ps. 34:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Zec1.11-13">Zech. 1:11&ndash;13</a>), and passages that mention &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">an</span> angel of the Lord&rdquo; (e.g., <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.11">Luke 1:11</a>) usually indicate an angel sent by God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. When Were Angels Created?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		All the angels must have been created before the seventh day of creation, for we read, &ldquo;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.1">Gen. 2:1</a>, understanding &ldquo;host&rdquo; to be the heavenly creatures that inhabit God&rsquo;s universe). Even more explicit than this is the statement, &ldquo;In six days the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> made heaven and earth, the sea, <span style="font-style:italic;">and all that is in them</span> and rested the seventh day&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex20.11">Ex. 20:11</a>). Therefore all the angels were created at least by the sixth day of creation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But can we be any more specific? There may be a hint at the creation of angelic beings on the first day of creation when we read that &ldquo;in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.1">Gen. 1:1</a>), and then immediately after we read that &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">earth</span> was without form and void&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.2">Gen. 1:2</a>), but with no mention of the heavens in this second verse. This may suggest that the uninhabitable state of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 402  </span>the earth is contrasted with the heavens where, perhaps, God had already created angelic beings and assigned them various roles and orders. This idea is made more plausible when we read that &ldquo;the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy&rdquo; at the time when God laid the &ldquo;cornerstone&rdquo; of the earth and sunk its &ldquo;bases&rdquo; in the process of forming or founding it (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job38.6-7">Job 38:6&ndash;7</a>). If the angels (&ldquo;the sons of God&rdquo;) shouted for joy when God was making the earth inhabitable, this could imply that God created the angelic beings early on the first day.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, since we have only hints in Scripture, we must remain content with the fact that God has not given us much information about the time of the creation of the angels. Further speculation, apart from clear scriptural data, would seem to be useless. &ldquo;The secret things belong to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt29.29">Deut. 29:29</a>).
	</p>

		Some time before Satan tempted Eve in the garden (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.1">Gen. 3:1</a>), a number of angels sinned and rebelled against God (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud6">Jude 6</a>). This event occurred apparently after the sixth day of creation when &ldquo;God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.31">Gen. 1:31</a>), but beyond this, Scripture gives us no further information.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. The Place of Angels in God&rsquo;s Purpose</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Angels Show the Greatness of God&rsquo;s Love and Plan for Us</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Human beings and angels (using the term broadly) are the only moral, highly intelligent creatures that God has made. Therefore we can understand much about God&rsquo;s plan and love for us when we compare ourselves with angels.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The first distinction to be noted is that angels are never said to be made &ldquo;in the image of God,&rdquo; while human beings are several times said to be in God&rsquo;s image (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.26-27">Gen. 1:26&ndash;27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge9.6">9:6</a>). Since being in the image of God means to be like God, it seems fair to conclude that we are more like God even than the angels are.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is supported by the fact that God will someday give us authority over angels, to judge them: &ldquo;Do you not know that <span style="font-style:italic;">we are to judge angels?</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.3">1 Cor. 6:3</a>). Though we are &ldquo;for a little while lower than the angels&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.7">Heb. 2:7</a>), when our salvation is complete we will be exalted above angels and rule over them. In fact, even now, angels already serve us: &ldquo;Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth <span style="font-style:italic;">to serve</span> for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.14">Heb. 1:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The ability of human beings to bear children like themselves (Adam &ldquo;became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.3">Gen. 5:3</a>) is another element of our superiority to angels, who apparently cannot bear children (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt22.30">Matt. 22:30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk20.34-36">Luke 20:34&ndash;36</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Angels also demonstrate the greatness of God&rsquo;s love for us in that, though many angels sinned, none were saved. Peter tells us that &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">God did not spare the angels when they sinned</span> but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of nether gloom to be kept until the judgment&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a>). Jude says that &ldquo;the angels that did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling have been kept by him in eternal chains in the nether gloom until the judgment of the great day&rdquo; <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 403  </span>(<a href="https://ref.ly/Jud6">Jude 6</a>). And we read in Hebrews, &ldquo;For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.16">Heb. 2:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We see, therefore, that God created two groups of intelligent, moral creatures. Among the angels, many sinned, but God decided to redeem none of them. This was perfectly just for God to do, and no angel can ever complain that he has been treated unfairly by God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now among the other group of moral creatures, human beings, we also find that a large number (indeed, all) have sinned and turned away from God. As with the angels that sinned: God could have let all of us go on our self-chosen path toward eternal condemnation. Had God decided to save no one out of the entire sinful human race, he would be perfectly just to do so, and no one could complain of unfairness on his part.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But God decided to do much more than merely meet the demands of justice. He decided to save some sinful human beings. If he had decided to save only five human beings out of the entire human race, that would have been much more than justice: it would have been a great demonstration of mercy and grace. If he had decided to save only one hundred out of the whole human race, it would have been an amazing demonstration of mercy and love. But God in fact has chosen to do much more than that. He has decided to redeem out of sinful mankind a great multitude, whom no man can number, &ldquo;from every tribe and tongue and people and nation&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re5.9">Rev. 5:9</a>). This is incalculable mercy and love, far beyond our comprehension. It is all undeserved favor: it is all of grace. The striking contrast with the fate of angels brings this truth home to us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that we have been saved from a life of rebellion against God means that we are able to sing songs that angels will never be able to sing for all eternity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Redeemed&mdash;how I love to proclaim it!

		His child, and forever, I am.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This song, and all the great songs proclaiming our redemption in Christ, are ours alone to sing. Unfallen angels see us sing these songs and they rejoice (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk15.10">Luke 15:10</a>), but they will never be able to make them their own.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Angels Remind Us That the Unseen World Is Real</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Just as the Sadducees in Jesus&rsquo; day said that &ldquo;there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac23.8">Acts 23:8</a>), so many in our day deny the reality of anything they cannot see. But the biblical teaching on the existence of angels is a constant reminder to us that there is an unseen world that is very real. It was only when the Lord opened the eyes of Elisha&rsquo;s servant to the reality of this invisible world that the servant saw that &ldquo;the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki6.17">2 Kings 6:17</a>; this was a great angelic army sent to Dothan to protect Elisha from the Syrians). The psalmist, too, shows an awareness of the unseen world when he encourages the angels, &ldquo;Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his host!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps148.2">Ps. 148:2</a>). The author of Hebrews reminds us that when we worship we come into the heavenly Jerusalem to gather with &ldquo;innumerable angels in festal gathering&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.22">Heb. 12:22</a>), whom we do not see, but whose presence should fill us with both <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 404  </span>awe and joy. An unbelieving world may dismiss talk of angels as mere superstition, but Scripture offers it as insight into the state of affairs as they really are.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Angels Are Examples for Us</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In both their obedience and their worship angels provide helpful examples for us to imitate. Jesus teaches us to pray, &ldquo;Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.10">Matt. 6:10</a>). In heaven God&rsquo;s will is done by angels, immediately, joyfully, and without question. We are to pray daily that our obedience and the obedience of others would be like that of the angels in heaven. Their delight is to be God&rsquo;s humble servants, each faithfully and joyfully performing their assigned tasks, whether great or small. Our desire and prayer should be that we ourselves and all others on earth would do the same.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Angels also serve as our examples in their worship of God. The seraphim before God&rsquo;s throne see God in his holiness and continue to cry out, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is6.3">Isa. 6:3</a>). And John sees around God&rsquo;s throne a great angelic army, &ldquo;numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re5.11-12">Rev. 5:11&ndash;12</a>). As angels find it their highest joy to praise God continuously, should we not also delight each day to sing God&rsquo;s praise, counting this as the highest and most worthy use of our time and our greatest joy?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Angels Carry Out Some of God&rsquo;s Plans</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture sees angels as God&rsquo;s servants who carry out some of his plans in the earth. They bring God&rsquo;s messages to people (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.11-19">Luke 1:11&ndash;19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.26">Acts 8:26</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac10.3-8">10:3&ndash;8</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac10.22">22</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac27.23-24">27:23&ndash;24</a>). They carry out some of God&rsquo;s judgments, bringing a plague upon Israel (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Sa24.16-17">2 Sam. 24:16&ndash;17</a>), smiting the leaders of the Assyrian army (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ch32.21">2 Chron. 32:21</a>), striking King Herod dead because he did not give God glory (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.23">Acts 12:23</a>), or pouring out bowls of God&rsquo;s wrath on the earth (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re16.1">Rev. 16:1</a>). When Christ returns, angels will come with him as a great army accompanying their King and Lord (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt16.27">Matt. 16:27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk9.26">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Th1.7">2 Thess. 1:7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Angels also patrol the earth as God&rsquo;s representatives (<a href="https://ref.ly/Zec1.10-11">Zech. 1:10&ndash;11</a>) and carry out war against demonic forces (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da10.13">Dan. 10:13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.7-8">Rev. 12:7&ndash;8</a>). John in his vision saw an angel coming down from heaven, and he records that the angel &ldquo;seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.1-3">Rev. 20:1&ndash;3</a>). When Christ returns, an archangel will proclaim his coming (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.16">1 Thess. 4:16</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Re18.1-2">Rev. 18:1&ndash;2</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re18.21">21</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re19.17-18">19:17&ndash;18</a>; et al.).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Angels Directly Glorify God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Angels also serve another function: they minister directly to God by glorifying him. Thus, in addition to human beings, there are other intelligent, moral creatures who glorify God in the universe.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Angels also glorify God for his great plan of salvation as they see it unfold. When Christ was born in Bethlehem, a multitude of angels praised God and said, &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk2.14">Luke 2:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.6">Heb. 1:6</a>). Jesus tells us, &ldquo;There is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk15.10">Luke 15:10</a>), indicating that angels rejoice every time someone turns from his or her sins and trusts in Christ as Savior.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Paul proclaims the gospel so that people from diverse racial backgrounds, both Jews and Greeks, are brought into the church, he sees God&rsquo;s wise plan for the church as being displayed before the angels (and demons), for he says that he was called to preach to the Gentiles &ldquo;that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be <span style="font-style:italic;">made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.10">Eph. 3:10</a>). And Peter tells us that &ldquo;angels long to look&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.12">1 Peter 1:12</a>) into the glories of the plan of salvation as it works out in the lives of individual believers each day. Paul also notes that Christ was &ldquo;seen by angels&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.16">1 Tim. 3:16</a>), suggesting that they glorified God for Christ&rsquo;s life of obedience. Moreover, the fact that women were to have clothing that appropriately signaled that they were women, &ldquo;because of the angels&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.10">1 Cor. 11:10</a>), when the church assembled for worship, indicates that angels witness the lives of Christians and glorify God for our worship and obedience. Indeed, Paul reminds Timothy, when he wants to emphasize the seriousness of a command, that our actions are carried out in the presence of angelic witnesses: &ldquo;In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus <span style="font-style:italic;">and of the elect angels</span> I charge you to keep these rules without favor, doing nothing from partiality&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.21">1 Tim. 5:21</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.9">1 Cor. 4:9</a>). If Timothy follows Paul&rsquo;s instructions, angels will witness his obedience and glorify God; if he neglects to obey, angels will also see and be grieved.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. Our Relationship to Angels</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. We Should Be Aware of Angels in Our Daily Lives</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture makes it clear that God wants us to be aware of the existence of angels and of the nature of their activity. We should not therefore assume that its teaching about angels has nothing whatsoever to do with our lives today. Rather, there are several ways in which our Christian lives will be enriched by an awareness of the existence and ministry of angels in the world even today.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we come before God in worship, we are joining not only with the great company of believers who have died and come into God&rsquo;s presence in heaven, &ldquo;the spirits of just men made perfect,&rdquo; but also with a great throng of angels, &ldquo;innumerable angels in festal gathering&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.22-23">Heb. 12:22&ndash;23</a>). Though we do not ordinarily see or hear evidence of this heavenly worship, it certainly enriches our sense of reverence and joy in God&rsquo;s presence if we appreciate the fact that angels join us in the worship of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, we should be aware that angels are watching our obedience or <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 406  </span>disobedience to God through the day. Even if we think our sins are done in secret and bring grief to no one else, we should be sobered by the thought that perhaps even hundreds of angels witness our disobedience and are grieved. On the other hand, when we are discouraged and think that our faithful obedience to God is witnessed by no one and is an encouragement to no one, we can be comforted by the realization that perhaps hundreds of angels witness our lonely struggle, daily &ldquo;longing to look&rdquo; at the way Christ&rsquo;s great salvation finds expression in our lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As if to make the reality of angelic observation of our service to God more vivid, the author of Hebrews suggests that angels can sometimes take human form, apparently to make &ldquo;inspection visits,&rdquo; something like the newspaper&rsquo;s restaurant critic who disguises himself and visits a new restaurant. We read, &ldquo;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.2">Heb. 13:2</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge18.2-5">Gen. 18:2&ndash;5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge19.1-3">19:1&ndash;3</a>). This should make us eager to minister to the needs of others whom we do not know, all the while wondering if someday we will reach heaven and meet the angel whom we helped when he appeared temporarily as a human being in distress here on earth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we are suddenly delivered from a danger or distress, we might suspect that angels have been sent by God to help us, and we should be thankful. An angel shut the mouths of the lions so they would not hurt Daniel (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da6.22">Dan. 6:22</a>), delivered the apostles from prison (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.19-20">Acts 5:19&ndash;20</a>), later delivered Peter from prison (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.7-11">Acts 12:7&ndash;11</a>), and ministered to Jesus in the wilderness at a time of great weakness, immediately after his temptations had ended (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt4.11">Matt. 4:11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When a car suddenly swerves from hitting us, when we suddenly find footing to keep from being swept along in a raging river, when we walk unscathed in a dangerous neighborhood, should we not suspect that God has sent his angels to protect us? Does not Scripture promise, &ldquo;For he will give his angels charge of you to guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps91.11-12">Ps. 91:11&ndash;12</a>)? Should we not therefore thank God for sending angels to protect us at such times? It seems right that we should do so.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Cautions Regarding Our Relationship to Angels</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Beware of Receiving False Doctrine From Angels</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The Bible warns against receiving false doctrine from supposed angels: &ldquo;But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.8">Gal. 1:8</a>). Paul makes this warning because he knows that there is a possibility of deception. He says, &ldquo;Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.14">2 Cor. 11:14</a>). Similarly, the lying prophet who deceived the man of God in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki13">1 Kings 13</a> claimed, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">An angel spoke to me</span> by the word of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, saying, &ldquo;Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki13.18">1 Kings 13:18</a>). Yet the text of Scripture immediately adds in the same verse, &ldquo;But he lied to him.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 407  </span>These are all instances of <span style="font-style:italic;">false</span> doctrine or guidance being conveyed by angels. It is interesting that these examples show the clear possibility of satanic deception tempting us to disobey the clear teachings of Scripture or the clear commands of God (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki13.9">1 Kings 13:9</a>). These warnings should keep any Christians from being fooled by the claims of Mormons, for example, that an angel (Moroni) spoke to Joseph Smith and revealed to him the basis of the Mormon religion. Such &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; is contrary to the teachings of Scripture at many points (with respect to such doctrines as the Trinity, the person of Christ, justification by faith alone, and many others), and Christians should be warned against accepting these claims. The closing of the canon of Scripture (see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.1.3.0.0.0.0.0">3</a>) should also warn us that no further revelation of doctrine is to be given by God today, and any claims to have received additional revelation of doctrine from angels today should be immediately rejected as false.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Do Not Worship Angels, Pray to Them, or Seek Them</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> &ldquo;Worship of angels&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.18">Col. 2:18</a>) was one of the false doctrines being taught at Colossae. Moreover, an angel speaking to John in the book of Revelation warns John not to worship him: &ldquo;You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re19.10">Rev. 19:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nor should we pray to angels. We are to pray only to God, who alone is omnipotent and thus able to answer prayer and who alone is omniscient and therefore able to hear the prayers of all his people at once. By virtue of omnipotence and omniscience, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are also worthy of being prayed to, but this is not true of any other being. Paul warns us against thinking that any other &ldquo;mediator&rdquo; can come between us and God, &ldquo;for there is one God, and there is <span style="font-style:italic;">one mediator</span> between God and men, the man Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.5">1 Tim. 2:5</a>). If we were to pray to angels, it would be implicitly attributing to them a status equal to God, which we must not do. There is no example in Scripture of anyone praying to any specific angel or asking angels for help.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, Scripture gives us no warrant to seek for appearances of angels to us. They manifest themselves unsought. To seek such appearances would seem to indicate an unhealthy curiosity or a desire for some kind of spectacular event rather than a love for God and devotion to him and his work. Though angels did appear to people at various times in Scripture, the people apparently never sought those appearances. Our role is rather to talk to the Lord, who is himself the commander of all angelic forces. However, it would not seem wrong to ask God to fulfill his promise in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps91.11">Psalm 91:11</a> to send angels to protect us in times of need.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. Do Angels Appear to People Today?</span> In the earliest period of the church&rsquo;s history angels were active. An angel told Philip to travel south on a road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.26">Acts 8:26</a>), instructed Cornelius to send a messenger to get Peter to come from Joppa (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac10.3-6">Acts 10:3&ndash;6</a>), urged Peter to get up and walk out of the prison (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.6-11">Acts 12:6&ndash;11</a>), and promised Paul that no one on his ship would <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 408  </span>be lost and that he himself would stand before Caesar (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac27.23-24">Acts 27:23&ndash;24</a>). Moreover, the author of Hebrews encourages his readers, none of whom are apostles or even first-generation believers associated with the apostles (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.3">Heb. 2:3</a>), that <span style="font-style:italic;">they</span> should continue to show hospitality to strangers, apparently with the expectation that they too might sometime entertain angels without realizing it (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.2">Heb. 13:2</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There seems, therefore, no compelling reason to rule out the possibility of angelic appearances today. Some would dispute this on the grounds that the sufficiency of Scripture (see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.1.8.0.0.0.0.0">8</a>) and the closing of its canon (see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.1.3.0.0.0.0.0">3</a>) rule out the possibility of angelic manifestations now. They would say that we are not to expect God to communicate to us through angels. However, this conclusion does not follow. Though angels would not add to the doctrinal and moral content of Scripture, God <span style="font-style:italic;">could</span> communicate information to us through angels as he also does through prophecy or through ordinary communication from other persons, or through our observation of the world. If God can send another human being to warn us of danger or encourage us when we are downcast, there seems no inherent reason why he could not occasionally send an angel to do this as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, we should use <span style="font-style:italic;">extreme caution</span> in receiving guidance from an angel should such an unusual event happen. (It is perhaps noteworthy that very few instances of such events are recorded today, and many of these involve the communication of antiscriptural doctrine, indicating that they are actually demonic appearances.) The fact that demons can appear as angels of light (see <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.14">2 Cor. 11:14</a>) should warn us that the appearance of any angel-like creature does not guarantee that this being speaks truthfully: <span style="font-style:italic;">Scripture</span> is our guide, and no angelic creature can give authoritative teaching that is contrary to Scripture (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.8">Gal. 1:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		An angelic appearance today would be unusual. If one should (apparently) occur, we should evaluate it with caution. But there is no convincing reason for saying that such an event absolutely could not happen, particularly in a time of extreme danger or intense conflict with the forces of evil.

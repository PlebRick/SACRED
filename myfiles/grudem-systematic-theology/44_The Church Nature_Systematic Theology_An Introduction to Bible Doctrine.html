		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Definition</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">The church is the community of all true believers for all time.</span> This definition understands the church to be made of all those who are truly saved. Paul says, &ldquo;Christ loved <span style="font-style:italic;">the church</span> and gave himself up for her&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.25">Eph. 5:25</a>). Here the term &ldquo;the church&rdquo; is used to apply to all those whom Christ died to redeem, all those who are saved by the death of Christ. But that must include all true believers for all time, both believers in the New Testament age and believers in the Old Testament age as well. So great is God&rsquo;s plan for the church that he has exalted Christ to a position of highest authority for the sake of the church: &ldquo;He has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things <span style="font-style:italic;">for the church</span> which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.22-23">Eph. 1:22&ndash;23</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus Christ himself builds the church by calling his people to himself. He promised, &ldquo;I will build my church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt16.18">Matt. 16:18</a>). And Luke is careful to tell us that the growth of the church came not by human effort alone, but that &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the Lord</span> added to their number day by day those who were being saved&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.47">Acts 2:47</a>). But this process whereby Christ builds the church is just a continuation of the pattern established by God in the Old Testament whereby he called people to himself to be a worshiping assembly before him. There are several indications <span style="font-style:italic;">in the Old Testament</span> that God thought of his people as a &ldquo;church,&rdquo; a people assembled for the purpose of worshiping God. When Moses tells the people that the Lord said to him, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Gather the people to me</span> that I may let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt4.10">Deut. 4:10</a>), the Septuagint translates the word for &ldquo;gather&rdquo; (Heb. <span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">קָהַל</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK7735">H7735</a>) with the Greek term <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐκκλησιάζω</span> &ldquo;to summon an assembly,&rdquo; the verb that is cognate to the New Testament noun <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐκκλησία</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1711">G1711</a>) &ldquo;church.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 854  </span>It is not surprising, then, that the New Testament authors can speak of the Old Testament people of Israel as a &ldquo;church&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐκκλησία</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1711">G1711</a>). For example, Stephen speaks of the people of Israel in the wilderness as &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">church</span> (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐκκλησία</span>) in the wilderness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.38">Acts 7:38</a>, author&rsquo;s translation). And the author of Hebrews quotes Christ as saying that he would sing praise to God in the midst of the great assembly of God&rsquo;s people in heaven: &ldquo;In the midst of the church (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐκκλησία</span>) I will sing praise to you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.12">Heb. 2:12</a>, author&rsquo;s translation, quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22.22">Ps. 22:22</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore the author of Hebrews understands the present-day Christians who constitute the church on earth to be surrounded by a great &ldquo;cloud of witnesses&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.1">Heb. 12:1</a>) that reaches back into the earliest eras of the Old Testament and includes Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11.4-32">Heb. 11:4&ndash;32</a>). All these &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; surround the present-day people of God, and it seems only appropriate that they, together with the New Testament people of God, should be thought of as God&rsquo;s great spiritual &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; or &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Moreover, later in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12">12</a> the author of Hebrews says that when New Testament Christians worship we come into the presence of &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">assembly</span> (lit. &ldquo;church,&rdquo; Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐκκλησία</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1711">G1711</a>) of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven.&rdquo; This emphasis is not surprising in light of the fact that the New Testament authors see Jewish believers and Gentile believers alike to be now united in the church. Together they have been made &ldquo;one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.14">Eph. 2:14</a>), they are &ldquo;one new man&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.15">15</a>) and &ldquo;fellow citizens&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.19">19</a>), and &ldquo;members of the household of God&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.19">19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore, even though there are certainly new privileges and new blessings that are given to the people of God in the New Testament, both the usage of the term &ldquo;church&rdquo; in Scripture and the fact that throughout Scripture God has always called his people to assemble to worship himself, indicate that it is appropriate to think of the church as constituting all the people of God for all time, both Old Testament believers and New Testament believers.
	</p>

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 855  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Church Is Invisible, Yet Visible</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In its true spiritual reality as the fellowship of all genuine believers, the church is invisible. This is because we cannot see the spiritual condition of people&rsquo;s hearts. We can see those who outwardly attend the church, and we can see outward evidences of inward spiritual change, but we cannot actually see into people&rsquo;s hearts and view their spiritual state&mdash;only God can do that. This is why Paul says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord knows those who are his</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti2.19">2 Tim. 2:19</a>). Even in our own churches and our own neighborhoods, only God knows who are true believers with certainty and without error. In speaking of the church as invisible the author of Hebrews speaks of the &ldquo;assembly (literally, &ldquo;church&rdquo;) of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.23">Heb. 12:23</a>), and says that present-day Christians join with that assembly in worship.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We can give the following definition: <span style="font-style:italic;">The invisible church is the church as God sees it</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Both Martin Luther and John Calvin were eager to affirm this invisible aspect of the church over against the Roman Catholic teaching that the church was the one visible organization that had descended from the apostles in an unbroken line of succession (through the bishops of the church). The Roman Catholic Church had argued that only in the visible organization of the Roman Church could we find the one true church, the only true church. Even today such a view is held by the Roman Catholic Church. In their &ldquo;Pastoral Statement for Catholics on Biblical Fundamentalism&rdquo; issued March 25, 1987, the (United States) National Conference of Catholic Bishops Ad Hoc Committee on Biblical Fundamentalism criticized evangelical Christianity (which it called &ldquo;biblical fundamentalism&rdquo;) primarily because it took people away from the one true church:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The basic characteristic of biblical fundamentalism is that it eliminates from Christianity the church as the Lord Jesus founded it … There is no mention of the historic, authoritative church in continuity with Peter and the other apostles … A study of the New Testament … demonstrates the importance of belonging to the church started by Jesus Christ. Christ chose Peter and the other apostles as foundations of his church … Peter and the other apostles have been succeeded by <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 856  </span>the bishop of Rome and the other bishops, and … the flock of Christ still has, under Christ, a universal shepherd.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In response to that kind of teaching both Luther and Calvin disagreed. They said that the Roman Catholic Church had the outward form, the organization, but it was just a shell. Calvin argued that just as Caiaphas (the high priest at the time of Christ) was descended from Aaron but was no true priest, so the Roman Catholic bishops had &ldquo;descended&rdquo; from the apostles in a line of succession but they were not true bishops in Christ&rsquo;s church. Because they had departed from the true preaching of the gospel, their visible organization was not the true church. Calvin said, &ldquo;This pretense of succession is vain unless their descendants conserve safe and uncorrupted the truth of Christ which they have received at their fathers&rsquo; hands, and abide in it … See what value this succession has, unless it also include a true and uninterrupted emulation on the part of the successors!&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, the true church of Christ certainly has a visible aspect as well. We may use the following definition: <span style="font-style:italic;">The visible church is the church as Christians on earth see it</span>. In this sense the visible church includes all who profess faith in Christ and give evidence of that faith in their lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this definition we do not say that the visible church is the church as any person in the world (such as an unbeliever or someone who held heretical teachings) might see it, but we mean to speak of the church as it is perceived by those who are genuine believers and have an understanding of the difference between believers and unbelievers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Paul writes his epistles he writes to the visible church in each community: &ldquo;To the <span style="font-style:italic;">church</span> of God which is at Corinth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.2">1 Cor. 1:2</a>); &ldquo;To the <span style="font-style:italic;">church</span> of the Thessalonians&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th1.1">1 Thess. 1:1</a>); &ldquo;To Philemon … and Apphia … and Archippus … and the <span style="font-style:italic;">church</span> in your house&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Phm1-2">Philem. 1&ndash;2</a>). Paul certainly realized that there were unbelievers in some of those churches, some who had made a profession of faith that was not genuine, who appeared to be Christians but would eventually fall away. Yet neither Paul nor anyone else could tell with certainty who those people were. Paul simply wrote to the entire church that met together in any one place. In this sense, we could say today that the visible church is the group of people who come together each week to worship as a church and profess faith in Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The visible church throughout the world will always include some unbelievers, and individual congregations will usually include some unbelievers, because we cannot see hearts as God sees them. Paul speaks of &ldquo;Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have swerved from the truth&rdquo; and who &ldquo;are upsetting the faith of some&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti2.17-18">2 Tim. 2:17&ndash;18</a>). But he is confident that &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are his&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti2.19">2 Tim. 2:19</a>). Paul says with sorrow, &ldquo;Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti4.10">2 Tim. 4:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 857  </span>Similarly, Paul warns the Ephesian elders that after his departure &ldquo;fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; and <span style="font-style:italic;">from among your own selves</span> will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.29-30">Acts 20:29&ndash;30</a>). Jesus himself warned, &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, <span style="font-style:italic;">who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing</span> but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.15-16">Matt. 7:15&ndash;16</a>). Realizing this distinction between the church invisible and the church visible, Augustine said of the visible church, &ldquo;Many sheep are without and many wolves are within.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we recognize that there are unbelievers in the visible church, there is a danger that we may become overly suspicious. We may begin to doubt the salvation of many true believers and thereby bring great confusion into the church. Calvin warned against this danger by saying that we must make a &ldquo;charitable judgment&rdquo; whereby we recognize as members of the church all who &ldquo;by confession of faith, by example of life, and by partaking of the sacraments, profess the same God and Christ with us.&rdquo; We should not try to exclude people from the fellowship of the church until they by public sin bring discipline upon themselves. On the other hand, of course, the church should not tolerate in its membership &ldquo;public unbelievers&rdquo; who by profession or life clearly proclaim themselves to be outside the true church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. The Church Is Local and Universal</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In the New Testament the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; may be applied to a group of believers at any level, ranging from a very small group meeting in a private home all the way to the group of all true believers in the universal church. A &ldquo;house church&rdquo; is called a &ldquo;church&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.5">Romans 16:5</a> (&ldquo;greet also <span style="font-style:italic;">the church in their house</span>&rdquo;), <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co16.19">1 Corinthians 16:19</a> (&ldquo;Aquila and Prisca, together with <span style="font-style:italic;">the church in their house</span> send you hearty greetings in the Lord&rdquo;). The church in an entire city is also called &ldquo;a church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.2">1 Cor. 1:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co1.1">2 Cor. 1:1</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th1.1">1 Thess. 1:1</a>). The church in a region is referred to as a &ldquo;church&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.31">Acts 9:31</a>: &ldquo;So <span style="font-style:italic;">the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria</span> had peace and was built up.&rdquo; Finally, the church throughout the entire world can be referred to as &ldquo;the church.&rdquo; Paul says, &ldquo;Christ loved <span style="font-style:italic;">the church</span> and gave himself up for her&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.25">Eph. 5:25</a>) and says, &ldquo;God has appointed <span style="font-style:italic;">in the church</span> first apostles, second prophets, third teachers …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.28">1 Cor. 12:28</a>). In this latter verse the mention of &ldquo;apostles,&rdquo; who were not given to any individual church, guarantees that the reference is to the church universal.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may conclude that the group of God&rsquo;s people considered at any level from local to universal may rightly be called &ldquo;a church.&rdquo; We should not make the mistake of saying that only a church meeting in houses expresses the true nature of the church, or only a church considered at a city-wide level can rightly be called a <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 858  </span>church, or only the church universal can rightly be called by the name &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Rather, the community of God&rsquo;s people considered at any level can be rightly called a church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Metaphors for the Church</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> To help us understand the nature of the church, Scripture uses a wide range of metaphors and images to describe to us what the church is like. There are several family images&mdash;for example, Paul views the church as a <span style="font-style:italic;">family</span> when he tells Timothy to act as if all the church members were members of a larger family: &ldquo;Do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as you would a father; treat younger men like brothers, older women like mothers, younger women like sisters, in all purity&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.1-2">1 Tim. 5:1&ndash;2</a>). God is our heavenly Father (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.14">Eph. 3:14</a>), and we are his sons and daughters, for God says to us, &ldquo;I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co6.18">2 Cor. 6:18</a>). We are therefore brothers and sisters with each other in God&rsquo;s family (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.49-50">Matt. 12:49&ndash;50</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.14-18">1 John 3:14&ndash;18</a>). A somewhat different family metaphor is seen when Paul refers to the church as the <span style="font-style:italic;">bride of Christ</span>. He says that the relationship between a husband and wife &ldquo;refers to Christ and the church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.32">Eph. 5:32</a>), and he says that he brought about the engagement between Christ and the church at Corinth and that it resembles an engagement between a bride and her husband-to-be: &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband, that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.2">2 Cor. 11:2</a> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">nasb</span>)&mdash;here Paul is looking forward to the time of Christ&rsquo;s return as the time when the church will be presented to him as his bride.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In other metaphors Scripture compares the church to <span style="font-style:italic;">branches on a vine</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.5">John 15:5</a>), <span style="font-style:italic;">an olive tree</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.17-24">Rom. 11:17&ndash;24</a>), <span style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span style="font-style:italic;">field of crops</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.6-9">1 Cor. 3:6&ndash;9</a>), <span style="font-style:italic;">a building</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.9">1 Cor. 3:9</a>), and <span style="font-style:italic;">a harvest</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt13.1-30">Matt. 13:1&ndash;30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.35">John 4:35</a>). The church is also viewed as <span style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span style="font-style:italic;">new temple</span> not built with literal stones but built with Christian people who are &ldquo;living stones&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.5">1 Peter 2:5</a>) built up on the &ldquo;cornerstone&rdquo; who is Christ Jesus (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.4-8">1 Peter 2:4&ndash;8</a>). Yet the church is not only a new temple for worship of God; it is also <span style="font-style:italic;">a new group of priests</span> a &ldquo;holy priesthood&rdquo; that can offer &ldquo;spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.5">1 Pet. 2:5</a>). We are also viewed as <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s house</span>: &ldquo;And we are his house&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.6">Heb. 3:6</a>), with Jesus Christ himself viewed as the &ldquo;builder&rdquo; of the house (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.3">Heb. 3:3</a>). The church is also viewed as &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the pillar</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">bulwark of the truth</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.15">1 Tim. 3:15</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, another familiar metaphor views the church as <span style="font-style:italic;">the body of Christ</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.12-27">1 Cor. 12:12&ndash;27</a>). We should recognize that Paul in fact uses two different metaphors of the human body when he speaks of the church. In <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12">1 Corinthians 12</a> <span style="font-style:italic;">the whole body</span> is taken as a metaphor for the church, because Paul speaks of the &ldquo;ear&rdquo; and the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; and the &ldquo;sense of smell&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.16-17">1 Cor. 12:16&ndash;17</a>). In this metaphor, Christ is not viewed as the head joined to the body, because the individual members are themselves the individual parts of the head. Christ is in this metaphor the Lord who is &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of that body that represents the church and is the one whom the church serves and worships.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 859  </span>But in <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.22-23">Ephesians 1:22&ndash;23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.15-16">4:15&ndash;16</a>, and in <a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.19">Colossians 2:19</a>, Paul uses a different body metaphor to refer to the church. In these passages Paul says that Christ is the head and the church is like <span style="font-style:italic;">the rest of the body, as distinguished from the head</span>: &ldquo;We are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.15-16">Eph. 4:15&ndash;16</a>). We should not confuse these two metaphors in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12">1 Corinthians 12</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4">Ephesians 4</a>, but keep them distinct.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The wide range of metaphors used for the church in the New Testament should remind us not to focus exclusively on any one. For example, while it is true that the church is the body of Christ, we must remember that this is only one metaphor among many. If we focus exclusively on that metaphor we will be likely to forget that Christ is our Lord reigning in heaven as well as the one who dwells among us. Certainly we should not agree to the Roman Catholic view that the church is the &ldquo;continuing incarnation&rdquo; of the Son of God on earth today. The church is not the Son of God in the flesh, for Christ rose in his human body, he ascended in his human body into heaven, and he now reigns as the incarnate Christ in heaven, one who is clearly distinct from the church here on earth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Each of the metaphors used for the church can help us to appreciate more of the richness of privilege that God has given us by incorporating us into the church. The fact that the church is like a family should increase our love and fellowship with one another. The thought that the church is like the bride of Christ should stimulate us to strive for greater purity and holiness, and also greater love for Christ and submission to him. The image of the church as branches in a vine should cause us to rest in him more fully. The idea of an agricultural crop should encourage us to continue growing in the Christian life and obtaining for ourselves and others the proper spiritual nutrients to grow. The picture of the church as God&rsquo;s new temple should increase our awareness of God&rsquo;s very presence dwelling in our midst as we meet. The concept of the church as a priesthood should help us to see more clearly the delight God has in the sacrifices of praise and good deeds that we offer to him (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.15-16">Heb. 13:15&ndash;16</a>). The metaphor of the church as the body of Christ should increase our interdependence on one another and our appreciation of the diversity of gifts within the body. Many other applications could be drawn from these and other metaphors for the church listed in Scripture.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. The Church and Israel</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Among evangelical Protestants there has been a difference of viewpoint on the question of the relationship between Israel and the church. This question was brought into prominence by those who hold to a &ldquo;dispensational&rdquo; system of theology. The most extensive systematic theology written by a dispensationalist, Lewis Sperry Chafer&rsquo;s <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/chafersysth?pos=*CONTENTS*"><span style="font-style:italic;">Systematic Theology</span></a> points <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 860  </span>out many distinctions between Israel and the church, and even between believing Israel in the Old Testament and the church in the New Testament. Chafer argues that God has two distinct plans for the two different groups of people that he has redeemed: God&rsquo;s purposes and promises for <span style="font-style:italic;">Israel</span> are for <span style="font-style:italic;">earthly blessings</span> and they will yet be fulfilled on this earth at some time in the future. On the other hand, God&rsquo;s purposes and promises for <span style="font-style:italic;">the church</span> are for <span style="font-style:italic;">heavenly blessings</span> and those promises will be fulfilled in heaven. This distinction between the two different groups that God saves will especially be seen in the millennium, according to Chafer, for at that time Israel will reign on earth as God&rsquo;s people and enjoy the fulfillment of Old Testament promises, but the church will already have been taken up into heaven at the time of Christ&rsquo;s secret return for his saints (&ldquo;the rapture&rdquo;). On this view, the church did not begin until Pentecost (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2">Acts 2</a>). And it is not right to think of Old Testament believers together with New Testament believers as constituting one church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		While Chafer&rsquo;s position continues to have influence in some dispensational circles, and certainly in more popular preaching, a number of leaders among more recent dispensationalists have not followed Chafer in many of these points. Several current dispensational theologians, such as Robert Saucy, Craig Blaising, and Darrell Bock, refer to themselves as &ldquo;progressive dispensationalists,&rdquo; and they have gained a wide following. They <span style="font-style:italic;">would not see the church as a parenthesis</span> in God&rsquo;s plan but as the first step toward the establishment of the kingdom of God. On a progressive dispensational view, <span style="font-style:italic;">God does not have two separate purposes for Israel and the church</span> but a single purpose&mdash;the establishment of the kingdom of God&mdash;in which Israel and the church will both share. Progressive dispensationalists would see <span style="font-style:italic;">no distinction between Israel and the church in the future eternal state</span> for all will be part of the one people of God. Moreover, they would hold that the church will reign with Christ in <span style="font-style:italic;">glorified bodies on earth during the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">millennium</span> (see the discussion of the millennium in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.7.55.0.0.0.0.0">55</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, there is still a difference between progressive dispensationalists and the rest of evangelicalism on one point: they would say that <span style="font-style:italic;">the Old Testament prophecies concerning Israel will still be fulfilled in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">millennium</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> by ethnic Jewish people</span> who will believe in Christ and live in the land of Israel as a &ldquo;model nation&rdquo; for all nations to see and learn from. Therefore they would not say that the church is the &ldquo;new Israel&rdquo; or that all the Old Testament prophecies about Israel will be fulfilled in the church, for these prophecies will yet be fulfilled in ethnic Israel.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The position taken in this book differs quite a bit from Chafer&rsquo;s views on this issue and also differs somewhat with progressive dispensationalists. However, it must be said here that questions about the exact way in which biblical prophecies <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 861  </span>about the future will be fulfilled are, in the nature of the case, difficult to decide with certainty, and it is wise to have some tentativeness in our conclusions on these matters. With this in mind, the following may be said.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Both Protestant and Catholic theologians outside of the dispensational position have said that the church includes both Old Testament believers and New Testament believers in one church or one body of Christ. Even on the nondispensational view, a person may hold that there will be a future large-scale conversion of the Jewish people (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.12">Rom. 11:12</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.15">15</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.23-24">23&ndash;24</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.25-26">25&ndash;26</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.28-31">28&ndash;31</a>), yet that this conversion will only result in Jewish believers becoming part of the one true church of God&mdash;they will be &ldquo;grafted back into their own olive tree&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.24">Rom. 11:24</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With regard to this question, we should notice the many New Testament verses that understand the church as the &ldquo;new Israel&rdquo; or new &ldquo;people of God.&rdquo; The fact that &ldquo;Christ loved <span style="font-style:italic;">the church</span> and gave himself up for her&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.25">Eph. 5:25</a>) would suggest this. Moreover, this present church age, which has brought the salvation of many millions of Christians in the church, is not an interruption or a parenthesis in God&rsquo;s plan, but a continuation of his plan expressed throughout the Old Testament to call a people to himself. Paul says, &ldquo;For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical. <span style="font-style:italic;">He is a Jew who is one inwardly</span> and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, spiritual and not literal&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.28-29">Rom. 2:28&ndash;29</a>). Paul recognizes that though there is a literal or natural sense in which people who physically descended from Abraham are to be called Jews, there is also a deeper or spiritual sense in which a &ldquo;true Jew&rdquo; is one who is inwardly a believer and whose heart has been cleansed by God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul says that Abraham is not only to be considered the father of the Jewish people in a physical sense. He is also in a deeper and more true sense &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the father of all who believe</span> without being circumcised … and likewise the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but also follow the example of the faith which our father Abraham had&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.11-12">Rom. 4:11&ndash;12</a>; cf. vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.16">16</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.18">18</a>). Therefore Paul can say, &ldquo;not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, and not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants … it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.6-8">Rom. 9:6&ndash;8</a>). Paul here implies that the true children of Abraham, those who are in the most true sense &ldquo;Israel,&rdquo; are not the nation of Israel by physical descent from Abraham but those who have believed in Christ. Those who truly believe in Christ are now the ones who have the privilege of being called &ldquo;my people&rdquo; by the Lord (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.25">Rom. 9:25</a>, quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Ho2.23">Hos. 2:23</a>); therefore, the church is now God&rsquo;s chosen people. This means that when Jewish people according to the flesh are saved in large numbers at some time in the future, they will not constitute a separate people of God or be like a separate olive tree, but they will be &ldquo;grafted back <span style="font-style:italic;">into their own olive tree</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.24">Rom. 11:24</a>). Another passage <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 862  </span>indicating this is <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.29">Galatians 3:29</a>: &ldquo;And if you are Christ&rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.&rdquo; Similarly, Paul says that Christians are the &ldquo;true circumcision&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.3">Phil. 3:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Far from thinking of the church as a separate group from the Jewish people, Paul writes to Gentile believers at Ephesus telling them that they were formerly &ldquo;alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.12">Eph. 2:12</a>), but that now they have been &ldquo;brought near in the blood of Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.13">Eph. 2:13</a>). And when the Gentiles were brought into the church, Jews and Gentiles were united into one new body. Paul says that God &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">has made us both one</span> and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility … that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, and might <span style="font-style:italic;">reconcile us both to God in one body</span> through the cross&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.14-16">Eph. 2:14&ndash;16</a>). Therefore Paul can say that Gentiles are &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">fellow citizens with the saints</span> and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.19-20">Eph. 2:19&ndash;20</a>). With his extensive awareness of the Old Testament background to the New Testament church, Paul can still say that &ldquo;the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.6">Eph. 3:6</a>). The entire passage speaks strongly of the unity of Jewish and Gentile believers in one body in Christ and gives no indication of any distinctive plan for Jewish people ever to be saved apart from inclusion in the one body of Christ, the church. The church incorporates into itself all the true people of God, and almost all of the titles used of God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament are in one place or another applied to the church in the New Testament.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb8">Hebrews 8</a> provides another strong argument for seeing the church as the recipient, and the fulfillment, of the Old Testament promises concerning Israel. In the context of speaking about the new covenant to which Christians belong, the author of Hebrews gives an extensive quotation from <a href="https://ref.ly/Je31.31-34">Jeremiah 31:31&ndash;34</a>, in which he says, &ldquo;The days will come, says the Lord, when I will establish a new <span style="font-style:italic;">covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah …</span> . This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb8.8-10">Heb. 8:8&ndash;10</a>). Here the author quotes the Lord&rsquo;s promise that he will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and <span style="font-style:italic;">with the house of Judah</span> and says that that is the new covenant that has now been made <span style="font-style:italic;">with the church</span>. That new covenant is the covenant of which believers in the church are now members. It seems hard to avoid the conclusion that the author views the church as the true Israel of God in which the Old Testament promises to Israel find their fulfillment.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, James can write a general letter to many early Christian churches and say that he is writing &ldquo;To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.1">James 1:1</a>). This indicates that he is evidently viewing New Testament Christians as the successors to and fulfillment of the twelve tribes of Israel.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Peter also speaks in the same way. From the first verse in which he calls his readers &ldquo;exiles of the Dispersion&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.1">1 Peter 1:1</a>) to the next-to-last verse in which he calls the city of Rome &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.13">1 Peter 5:13</a>), Peter frequently speaks of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 863  </span>New Testament Christians in terms of Old Testament imagery and promises given to the Jews. This theme comes to prominence in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.4-10">1 Peter 2:4&ndash;10</a>, where Peter says that God has bestowed on the church almost all the blessings promised to Israel in the Old Testament. The dwelling-place of God is no longer the Jerusalem temple, for Christians are the new &ldquo;temple&rdquo; of God (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.5">5</a>). The priesthood able to offer acceptable sacrifices to God is no longer descended from Aaron, for Christians are now the true &ldquo;royal priesthood&rdquo; with access before God&rsquo;s throne (vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.4-5">4&ndash;5</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.9">9</a>). God&rsquo;s chosen people are no longer said to be those physically descended from Abraham, for Christians are now the true &ldquo;chosen race&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.9">9</a>). The nation blessed by God is no longer said to be the nation of Israel, for Christians are now God&rsquo;s true &ldquo;holy nation&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.9">9</a>). The people of Israel are no longer said to be the people of God, for Christians&mdash;both Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians&mdash;are now &ldquo;God&rsquo;s people&rdquo; and those who have &ldquo;received mercy&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.10">10</a>). Moreover, Peter takes these quotations from contexts in the Old Testament that repeatedly warn that God will reject his people who persist in rebellion against him and who reject the precious &ldquo;cornerstone&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.6">6</a>) that he has established. What further statement could be needed in order for us to say with assurance that the church has now become the true Israel of God and will receive all the blessings promised to Israel in the Old Testament?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. The Church and the Kingdom of God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> What is the relationship between the church and the kingdom of God? The differences have been summarized well by George Ladd:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Kingdom is primarily the dynamic reign or kingly rule of God, and, derivatively, the sphere in which the rule is experienced. In biblical idiom, the Kingdom is not identified with its subjects. They are the people of God&rsquo;s rule who enter it, live under it, and are governed by it. The church is the community of the Kingdom but never the Kingdom itself. Jesus&rsquo; disciples belong to the Kingdom as the Kingdom belongs to them; but they are not the Kingdom. The Kingdom is the rule of God; the church is a society of men.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Ladd goes on to summarize five specific aspects of the relationship between the kingdom and the church: (1) The church is not the kingdom (for Jesus and the early Christians preached that the kingdom of God was near, not that the church was near, and preached the good news of the kingdom, not the good news of the church: <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.12">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac19.8">19:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.25">20:25</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac28.23">28:23</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac28.31">31</a>). (2) The kingdom creates the church (for as people enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom they become joined to the human fellowship of the church). (3) The church witnesses to the kingdom (for Jesus said, &ldquo;this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.14">Matt. 24:14</a>). (4) The church is the instrument of the kingdom (for the Holy Spirit, manifesting the power of the kingdom, works through the disciples to heal <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 864  </span>the sick and cast out demons, as he did in the ministry of Jesus: <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.8">Matt. 10:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk10.17">Luke 10:17</a>). (5) The church is the custodian of the kingdom (for the church has been given the keys of the kingdom of heaven: <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt16.19">Matt. 16:19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore we should not identify the kingdom of God and the church (as in Roman Catholic theology), nor should we see the kingdom of God as entirely future, something distinct from the church age (as in older dispensational theology). Rather, we should recognize that there is a close connection between the kingdom of God and the church. As the church proclaims the good news of the kingdom, people will come into the church and begin to experience the blessings of God&rsquo;s rule in their lives. The kingdom manifests itself through the church, and thereby the future reign of God breaks into the present (it is &ldquo;already&rdquo; here: <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.28">Matt. 12:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro14.17">Rom. 14:17</a>; and &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; here fully: <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.34">Matt. 25:34</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.9-10">1 Cor. 6:9&ndash;10</a>). Therefore those who believe in Christ will begin to experience something of what God&rsquo;s final kingdom reign will be like: they will know some measure of victory over sin (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.14">Rom. 6:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro14.17">14:17</a>), over demonic opposition (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk10.17">Luke 10:17</a>), and over disease (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk10.9">Luke 10:9</a>). They will live in the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.28">Matt. 12:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.4-17">Rom. 8:4&ndash;17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro14.17">14:17</a>), who is the dynamic power of the coming kingdom. Eventually Jesus will return and his kingdom reign will extend over all creation (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.24-28">1 Cor. 15:24&ndash;28</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. The &ldquo;Marks&rdquo; of the Church (Distinguishing Characteristics)</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. There Are True Churches and False Churches</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> What makes a church a church? What is necessary to have a church? Might a group of people who claim to be Christians become so unlike what a church should be that they should no longer be called a church?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the early centuries of the Christian church, there was little controversy about what was a true church. There was only one world-wide church, the &ldquo;visible&rdquo; church throughout the world, and that was, of course, the true church. This church had bishops and local clergymen and church buildings which everyone could see. Any heretics who were found to be in serious doctrinal error were simply excluded from the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But at the Reformation a crucial question came up: how can we recognize a true church? Is the Roman Catholic Church a true church or not? In order to answer that question people had to decide what were the &ldquo;marks&rdquo; of a true church, the distinguishing characteristics that lead us to recognize it as a true church. Scripture certainly speaks of false churches. Paul says of the pagan temples in Corinth, &ldquo;What pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.20">1 Cor. 10:20</a>). He tells the Corinthians that &ldquo;when you were heathen, you were led astray to dumb idols&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.2">1 Cor. 12:2</a>). These pagan temples were certainly false churches or false religious assemblies. Moreover, Scripture speaks of a religious assembly that is really a &ldquo;synagogue of Satan&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.9">Rev. 2:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.9">3:9</a>). Here the risen Lord Jesus seems to be referring to Jewish assemblies that claim to be Jews but were not true Jews who had saving faith. Their religious assembly was not an assembly of Christ&rsquo;s people but of those who still belonged to the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of Satan. This also would certainly be a false church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 865  </span>In large measure there was agreement between Luther and Calvin on the question of what constituted a true church. The Lutheran statement of faith, which is called the Augsburg Confession (1530), defined the church as &ldquo;the congregation of saints in which the gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments rightly administered&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BookOfConcord.Ap:_art._viii">Article 7</a>). Similarly, John Calvin said, &ldquo;Wherever we see the Word of God purely preached and heard, and the sacraments administered according to Christ&rsquo;s institution, there, it is not to be doubted, a church of God exists.&rdquo; Although Calvin spoke of the pure preaching of the Word (whereas the Lutheran Confession spoke of the right preaching of the gospel) and although Calvin said that the Word must not only be preached but heard (whereas the Augsburg Confession merely mentioned that it had to be rightly taught), their understanding of the distinguishing marks of a true church is quite similar. In contrast to the view of Luther and Calvin regarding the marks of a church, the Roman Catholic position has been that <span style="font-style:italic;">the visible church</span> that descended from Peter and the apostles <span style="font-style:italic;">is the true church</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It seems appropriate that we take Luther and Calvin&rsquo;s view on the marks of a true church as correct still today. Certainly if the Word of God is not being preached, but simply false doctrines or doctrines of men, then there is no true church. In some cases we might have difficulty determining just how much wrong doctrine can be tolerated before a church can no longer be considered a true church, but there are many clear cases where we can say that a true church does not exist. For example, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormon Church) does not hold to any major Christian doctrines concerning salvation or the person of God or the person and work of Christ. It is clearly a false church. Similarly, the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses teach salvation by works, not by trusting in Jesus Christ alone. This is a fundamental doctrinal deviation because if people believe the teachings of the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, they simply will not be saved. So the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses also must be considered a false church. When the preaching of a church conceals the gospel message of salvation by faith alone from its members, so that the gospel message is not clearly proclaimed, and has not been proclaimed for some time, the group meeting there is not a church.

		The second mark of the church, the right administration of the sacraments (baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper) was probably stated in opposition to the Roman Catholic view that saving grace came through the sacraments and thereby the sacraments were made &ldquo;works&rdquo; by which we earned merit for salvation. In this way, the Roman Catholic Church was insisting on payment rather than teaching faith as the means of obtaining salvation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But another reason exists for including the sacraments as a mark of the church. Once an organization begins to practice baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, it is a continuing organization and is <span style="font-style:italic;">attempting to function as a church</span>. (In modern American society, an organization that begins to meet for worship and prayer and Bible teachings on Sunday mornings also would clearly be attempting to function as a church.)

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper also serve as &ldquo;membership controls&rdquo; for the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 866  </span>church. Baptism is the means for admitting people into the church, and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is the means for allowing people to give a sign of continuing in the membership of the church&mdash;the church signifies that it considers those who receive baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper to be saved. Therefore these activities indicate what a church thinks about salvation, and they are appropriately listed as a mark of the church today as well. By contrast, groups who do not administer baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper signify that they are not intending to function as a church. Someone may stand on a street corner with a small crowd and have true preaching and hearing of the Word, but the people there would not be a church. Even a neighborhood Bible study meeting in a home can have the true teaching and hearing of the Word without becoming a church. But if a local Bible study began baptizing its own new converts and regularly participating in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, these things would signify <span style="font-style:italic;">an intention to function as a church</span> and it would be difficult to say why it should not be considered a church in itself.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. True and False Churches Today</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In view of the question posed during the Reformation, what about the Roman Catholic Church today? Is it a true church? Here it seems that we cannot simply make a decision regarding the Roman Catholic Church as a whole, because it is far too diverse. To ask whether the Roman Catholic Church is a true church or a false church today is somewhat similar to asking whether Protestant churches are true or false today&mdash;there is great variety among them. Some Roman Catholic parishes certainly lack both marks: there is no pure preaching of the Word and the gospel message of salvation by faith in Christ alone is not known or received by people in the parish. Participation in the sacraments is seen as a &ldquo;work&rdquo; that can earn merit with God. Such a group of people is not a true Christian church. On the other hand, there are many Roman Catholic parishes in various parts of the world today where the local priest has a genuine saving knowledge of Christ and a vital personal relationship with Christ in prayer and Bible study. His own homilies and private teaching of the Bible place much emphasis on personal faith and the need for individual Bible reading and prayer. His teaching on the sacraments emphasizes their symbolic and commemorative aspects much more than it speaks of them as acts that merit some infusion of saving grace from God. In such a case, although we would have to say that we still have profound differences with Roman Catholic teaching on some doctrines, nonetheless, it would seem that such a church would have a close enough approximation to the two marks of the church that it would be hard to deny that it is in fact a true church. It would seem to be a genuine congregation of believers in which the gospel is taught (though not purely) and the sacraments are administered more rightly than wrongly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Are there false churches within Protestantism? If we again look at the two <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 867  </span>distinguishing marks of the church, in the judgment of this present writer it seems appropriate to say that many liberal Protestant churches are in fact false churches today. Is the gospel of works-righteousness and unbelief in Scripture that these churches teach any more likely to save people than did Roman Catholic teaching at the time of the Reformation? And is not their administration of the sacraments without sound teaching to anyone who walks in the door likely to give as much false assurance to unregenerate sinners as did the Roman Catholic use of the sacraments at the time of the Reformation? When there is an assembly of people who take the name &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; but consistently teach that people cannot believe their Bibles&mdash;indeed a church whose pastor and congregation seldom read their Bibles or pray in any meaningful way, and do not believe or perhaps even understand the gospel of salvation by faith in Christ alone, then how can we say that this is a true church?

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. The Purposes of the Church</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We can understand the purposes of the church in terms of ministry to God, ministry to believers, and ministry to the world.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Ministry to God: Worship</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In relationship to God the church&rsquo;s purpose is to worship him. Paul directs the church at Colossae to &ldquo;sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.16">Col. 3:16</a>). God has destined us and appointed us in Christ &ldquo;to live for the praise of his glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.12">Eph. 1:12</a>). Worship in the church is not merely a preparation for something else: it is in itself fulfilling the major purpose of the church with reference to its Lord. That is why Paul can follow an exhortation that we are to be &ldquo;making the most of the time&rdquo; with a command to be filled with the Spirit and then to be &ldquo;singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.16-19">Eph. 5:16&ndash;19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Ministry to Believers: Nurture</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> According to Scripture, the church has an obligation to nurture those who are already believers and build them up to maturity in the faith. Paul said that his own goal was not simply to bring people to initial saving faith but to &ldquo;present every man <span style="font-style:italic;">mature in Christ</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.28">Col. 1:28</a>). And he told the church at Ephesus that God gave the church gifted persons &ldquo;to equip the saints for the work of ministry, <span style="font-style:italic;">for building up the body of Christ</span> until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.12-13">Eph. 4:12&ndash;13</a>). It is clearly contrary to the New Testament pattern to think that our only goal <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 868  </span>with people is to bring them to initial saving faith. Our goal as a church must be to present to God every Christian &ldquo;mature in Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.28">Col. 1:28</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Ministry to the World: </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Evangelism</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> and Mercy</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Jesus told his disciples that they should &ldquo;make disciples of all nations&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.19">Matt. 28:19</a>). This evangelistic work of declaring the gospel is the primary ministry that the church has toward the world. Yet accompanying the work of evangelism is also a ministry of mercy, a ministry that includes caring for the poor and needy in the name of the Lord. Although the emphasis of the New Testament is on giving material help to those who are part of the church (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac11.29">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co8.4">2 Cor. 8:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.17">1 John 3:17</a>), there is still an affirmation that it is right to help unbelievers even if they do not respond with gratitude or acceptance of the gospel message. Jesus tells us,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for <span style="font-style:italic;">he is kind to the ungrateful and the selfish</span>. Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk6.35-36">Luke 6:35&ndash;36</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The point of Jesus&rsquo; explanation is that we are to imitate God in being kind to those who are being ungrateful and selfish as well. Moreover, we have the example of Jesus who did not attempt to heal only those who accepted him as Messiah. Rather, when great crowds came to him, &ldquo;he laid his hands <span style="font-style:italic;">on every one of them</span> and healed them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk4.40">Luke 4:40</a>). This should give us encouragement to carry out deeds of kindness, and to pray for healing and other needs, in the lives of unbelievers as well as believers. Such ministries of mercy to the world may also include participation in civic activities or attempting to influence governmental policies to make them more consistent with biblical moral principles. In areas where there is systematic injustice manifested in the treatment of the poor and/or ethnic or religious minorities, the church should also pray and&mdash;as it has opportunity&mdash;speak against such injustice. All of these are ways in which the church can supplement its evangelistic ministry to the world and indeed adorn the gospel that it professes. But such ministries of mercy to the world should never become a substitute for genuine evangelism or for the other areas of ministry to God and to believers mentioned above.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Keeping These Purposes in Balance</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Once we have listed these three purposes for the church someone might ask, Which is most important? Or someone else might ask, Might we neglect one of these three as less important than the others?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To that we must respond that all three purposes of the church are commanded by the Lord in Scripture; therefore all three are important and none can be neglected. In fact, a strong church will have effective ministries in all three of these areas. We should beware of any attempts to reduce the purpose of the church to only one of these three and to say that it should be our primary focus. In fact, such attempts to make one of these purposes primary will always result in some neglect of the other two. A church that emphasizes only worship will end up with inadequate Bible teaching of believers and its members will remain shallow in their <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 869  </span>understanding of Scripture and immature in their Christian lives. If it also begins to neglect evangelism the church will cease to grow and influence others; it will become ingrown and eventually begin to wither.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A church that places the edification of believers as a purpose that takes precedence over the other two will tend to produce Christians who know much Bible doctrine but have spiritual dryness in their lives because they know little of the joy of worshiping God or telling others about Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But a church that makes evangelism such a priority that it causes the other two purposes to be neglected will also end up with immature Christians who emphasize growth in numbers but have less and less genuine love for God expressed in their worship and less and less doctrinal maturity and personal holiness in their lives. All three purposes must be emphasized continually in a healthy church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, <span style="font-style:italic;">individuals</span> are different from churches in placing a relative priority on one or another of these purposes of the church. Because we are like a body with diverse spiritual gifts and abilities, it is right for us to place most of our emphasis on the fulfillment of that purpose of the church that is most closely related to the gifts and interests God has given to us. There is certainly no obligation for every believer to attempt to give exactly one third of his or her time in the church to worship, one-third to nurturing other believers, and one-third to evangelism or deeds of mercy. Someone with the gift of evangelism should of course spend some time in worship and caring for other believers, but may end up spending the vast majority of his or her time in evangelistic work. Someone who is a gifted worship leader may end up devoting 90 percent of his time in the church toward preparation for and leading of worship. This is only an appropriate response to the diversity of gifts that God has given us.

		 1. When you think of the church as the invisible fellowship of all true believers throughout all time, how does it affect the way you think of yourself as an individual Christian?

Do you think there is any harm done when evangelical Christians continue to give the impression that they think liberal Protestant churches are true Christian churches? Viewed from the perspective of the final judgment, what good and what harm might come from our failure to state that we think unbelieving churches are false churches?

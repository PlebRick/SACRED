		The Lord Jesus instituted two ordinances (or sacraments) to be observed by the church. The previous chapter discussed <span style="font-style:italic;">baptism</span> an ordinance that is only observed once by each person, as a sign of the beginning of his or her Christian life. This chapter discusses <span style="font-style:italic;">the Lord&rsquo;s Supper</span> an ordinance that is to be observed repeatedly throughout our Christian lives, as a sign of continuing in fellowship with Christ.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus instituted the Lord&rsquo;s Supper in the following way:

		Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body.&rdquo; And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&rsquo;s kingdom. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.26-29">Matt. 26:26&ndash;29</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul adds the following sentences from the tradition he received (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.23">1 Cor. 11:23</a>):
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.25">1 Cor. 11:25</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Is there a background to this ceremony in the Old Testament? It seems that there is, for there were instances of eating and drinking in the presence of God in the old covenant as well. For example, when the people of Israel were camped before Mount Sinai, just after God had given the Ten Commandments, God called the leaders of Israel up to the mountain to meet with him:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel … <span style="font-style:italic;">they beheld God, and ate and drank</span>. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex24.9-11">Ex. 24:9&ndash;11</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, every year the people of Israel were to tithe (give one-tenth of) all their crops. Then the law of Moses specified,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 989  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Before the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> your God</span> in the place which he will choose, to make his name dwell there, <span style="font-style:italic;">you shall eat the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstlings of your herd and flock;</span> that you may learn to fear the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> your God always … <span style="font-style:italic;">You shall eat there before the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> your God and rejoice</span> you and your household. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt14.23">Deut. 14:23</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt14.26">26</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But even earlier than that, God had put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and given them all of its abundance to eat (except the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil). Since there was no sin in that situation, and since God had created them for fellowship with himself and to glorify himself, then every meal that Adam and Eve ate would have been a meal of feasting in the presence of the Lord.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When this fellowship in God&rsquo;s presence was later broken by sin, God still allowed some meals (such as the tithe of fruits mentioned above) that the people would eat in his presence. These meals were a partial restoration of the fellowship with God that Adam and Eve enjoyed before the Fall, even though it was marred by sin. But the fellowship of eating in the presence of the Lord that we find in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is far better. The Old Testament sacrificial meals continually pointed to the fact that sins were not yet paid for, because the sacrifices in them were repeated year after year, and because they looked forward to the Messiah who was to come and take away sin (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.1-4">Heb. 10:1&ndash;4</a>). The Lord&rsquo;s Supper, however, reminds us that Jesus&rsquo; payment for our sins has already been accomplished, so we now eat in the Lord&rsquo;s presence with great rejoicing.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet even the Lord&rsquo;s Supper looks forward to a more wonderful fellowship meal in God&rsquo;s presence in the future, when the fellowship of Eden will be restored and there will be even greater joy, because those who eat in God&rsquo;s presence will be forgiven sinners now confirmed in righteousness, never able to sin again. That future time of great rejoicing and eating in the presence of God is hinted at by Jesus when he says, &ldquo;I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine <span style="font-style:italic;">until that day when I drink it new with you</span> in my Father&rsquo;s kingdom&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.29">Matt. 26:29</a>). We are told more explicitly in Revelation about the marriage supper of the Lamb: &ldquo;And the angel said to me, &lsquo;Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re19.9">Rev. 19:9</a>). This will be a time of great rejoicing in the presence of the Lord, as well as a time of reverence and awe before him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		From Genesis to Revelation, then, God&rsquo;s aim has been to bring his people into fellowship with himself, and one of the great joys of experiencing that fellowship is the fact that we can eat and drink in the presence of the Lord. It would be healthy for the church today to recapture a more vivid sense of God&rsquo;s presence at the table of the Lord.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. The Meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is complex, rich, and full. There are several things symbolized and affirmed in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Christ&rsquo;s Death</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s supper we symbolize the death of Christ because our actions give a picture of his death for us. When the bread is broken it symbolizes the breaking of Christ&rsquo;s body, and when the cup is <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 990  </span>poured out it symbolizes the pouring out of Christ&rsquo;s blood for us. This is why participating in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is also a kind of proclamation: &ldquo;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, <span style="font-style:italic;">you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death</span> until he comes&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.26">1 Cor. 11:26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Our Participation in the Benefits of Christ&rsquo;s Death</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Jesus commanded his disciples, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.26">Matt. 26:26</a>). As we individually reach out and take the cup for ourselves, each one of us is by that action proclaiming, &ldquo;I am taking the benefits of Christ&rsquo;s death to myself.&rdquo; When we do this we give a symbol of the fact that we participate in or share in the benefits earned for us by the death of Jesus.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Spiritual Nourishment</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Just as ordinary food nourishes our physical bodies, so the bread and wine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper give nourishment to us. But they also picture the fact that there is spiritual nourishment and refreshment that Christ is giving to our souls&mdash;indeed, the ceremony that Jesus instituted is in its very nature designed to teach us this. Jesus said,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.53-57">John 6:53&ndash;57</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Certainly Jesus is not speaking of a literal eating of his flesh and blood. But if he is not speaking of a literal eating and drinking, then he must have in mind a spiritual participation in the benefits of the redemption he earns. This spiritual nourishment, so necessary for our souls, is both symbolized and experienced in our participation in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. The Unity of Believers</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When Christians participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper together they also give a clear sign of their unity with one another. In fact, Paul says, &ldquo;Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.17">1 Cor. 10:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(218, 224, 194);">When we put these four things together, we begin to realize some of the rich meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper: when I participate I come into the presence of Christ; I remember that he died for me; I participate in the benefits of his death; I receive spiritual nourishment; and I am united with all other believers who participate in this Supper. What great cause for thanksgiving and joy is to be found in this Supper of the Lord!</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But in addition to these truths visibly portrayed by the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the fact that Christ has instituted this ceremony for us means that by it he is also promising or affirming certain things to us as well. When we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, we should be reminded again and again of the following affirmations that Christ is making to us:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 991  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Christ Affirms His Love for Me</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The fact that I am able to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper&mdash;indeed, that Jesus <span style="font-style:italic;">invites me</span> to come&mdash;is a vivid reminder and visual reassurance that Jesus Christ loves <span style="font-style:italic;">me</span> individually and personally. When I come to take of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper I thereby find reassurance again and again of Christ&rsquo;s personal love for me.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. Christ Affirms That All the Blessings of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Salvation</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Are Reserved for Me</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When I come at Christ&rsquo;s invitation to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the fact that he has invited me into his presence assures me that he has abundant blessings for me. In this Supper I am actually eating and drinking at a foretaste of the great banquet table of the King. I come to his table as a member of his <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal</span> family. When the Lord welcomes me to this table, he assures me that he will welcome me to all the other blessings of earth and heaven as well, and especially to the great marriage supper of the Lamb, at which a place has been reserved for me.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">7. I Affirm My Faith in Christ</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Finally, as I take the bread and cup for myself, by my actions I am proclaiming, &ldquo;I need you and trust you, Lord Jesus, to forgive my sins and give life and health to my soul, for only by your broken body and shed blood can I be saved.&rdquo; In fact, as I partake in the breaking of the bread when I eat it and the pouring out of the cup when I drink from it, I proclaim again and again that <span style="font-style:italic;">my sins</span> were part of the cause of Jesus&rsquo; suffering and death. In this way sorrow, joy, thanksgiving, and deep love for Christ are richly intermingled in the beauty of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. How Is Christ Present in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Roman Catholic View: Transubstantiation</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, the bread and wine <span style="font-style:italic;">actually become</span> the body and blood of Christ. This happens at the moment the priest says, &ldquo;This is my body&rdquo; during the celebration of the mass. At the same time as the priest says this, the bread is raised up (elevated) and adored. This action of elevating the bread and pronouncing it to be Christ&rsquo;s body can only be performed by a priest.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When this happens, according to Roman Catholic teaching, grace is imparted to those present <span style="font-style:italic;" lang="la">ex opere operato</span> that is, &ldquo;by the work performed,&rdquo; but the amount of grace dispensed is in proportion to the subjective disposition of the recipient of grace. Moreover, every time the mass is celebrated, the sacrifice of Christ is repeated (in some sense), and the Catholic church is careful to affirm that this is a real sacrifice, even though it is not the same as the sacrifice that Christ paid on the cross.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So Ludwig Ott&rsquo;s <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?pos=*CONTENTS*"><span style="font-style:italic;">Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma</span></a> teaches as follows:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 992  </span>Christ becomes present in the Sacrament of the Altar by the transformation of the whole substance of the bread into His Body and of the whole substance of the wine into His Blood … This transformation is called Transubstantiation. (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?ref=Page.p+379">379</a>)

	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The power of consecration resides in a validly consecrated priest only. (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?ref=Page.p+397">397</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Worship of Adoration (Latria) must be given to Christ present in the Eucharist … It follows from the wholeness and permanence of the Real Presence that the absolute worship of adoration (Cultus Latriae) is due to Christ present in the Eucharist. (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?ref=Page.p+387">387</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In Catholic teaching, because the elements of bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Christ, the church for many centuries did not allow the lay people to drink from the cup of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (for fear that the blood of Christ would be spilled) but only to eat the bread. Ott&rsquo;s textbook tells us,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Communion under two forms is not necessary for any individual member of the Faithful, either by reason of Divine precept or as a means of salvation … The reason is that Christ is whole and entire under each species … The abolition of the reception from the chalice in the Middle Ages (12th and 13th centuries) was enjoined for practical reasons, particularly danger of profanation of the Sacrament. (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?ref=Page.p+397">397</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With respect to the actual sacrifice of Christ in the mass, Ott&rsquo;s textbook says,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Holy Mass is a true and proper Sacrifice. (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?ref=Page.p+402">402</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the Sacrifice of the Mass and in the Sacrifice of the Cross the Sacrificial Gift and the Primary Sacrificing Priest are identical; only the nature and mode of the offering are different … The Sacrificial Gift is the Body and Blood of Christ … The Primary Sacrificing Priest is Jesus Christ, who utilizes the human priest as His servant and representative and fulfills the consecration through him. According to the Thomistic view, <span style="font-style:italic;">in every Mass Christ also performs an actual immediate sacrificial activity</span> which, however, must not be conceived as a totality of many successive acts but as one single uninterrupted sacrificial act of the Transfigured Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The purpose of the Sacrifice is the same in the Sacrifice of the Mass as in the Sacrifice of the Cross; primarily the glorification of God, secondarily atonement, thanksgiving and appeal. (p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?ref=Page.p+408">408</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">As a propitiatory sacrifice … the Sacrifice of the Mass effects the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">remission of sins</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> and the punishment for sins;</span> as a sacrifice of appeal … it brings about the conferring of supernatural and natural gifts. The Eucharistic Sacrifice of propitiation can, as the Council of Trent expressly asserted, be offered, not merely for the living, but also for the poor souls in Purgatory. (pp. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/fundcatdogma?ref=Page.pp+412-413">412&ndash;13</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In response to the Roman Catholic teaching on the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, it must be said that it first fails to recognize the symbolic character of Jesus&rsquo; statements when he declared, &ldquo;This is my body,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;This is my blood.&rdquo; Jesus spoke in symbolic ways many times when speaking of himself. He said, for example, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I am the true </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 993  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">vine</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.1">John 15:1</a>), or &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I am the door;</span> if any one enters by me, he will be saved&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.9">John 10:9</a>), or &ldquo;I am the bread which came down from heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.41">John 6:41</a>). In a similar way, when Jesus says, &ldquo;This is my body,&rdquo; he means it in a symbolic way, not in an actual, literal, physical way. In fact, as he was sitting with his disciples holding the bread, the bread was in his hand but it was distinct from his body, and that was, of course, evident to the disciples. None of the disciples present would have thought that the loaf of bread that Jesus held in his hand was actually his physical body, for they could see his body before their eyes. They would have naturally understood Jesus&rsquo; statement in a symbolic way. Similarly, when Jesus said, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">This cup</span> which is poured out for you <span style="font-style:italic;">is the new covenant</span> in my blood&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk22.20">Luke 22:20</a>), he certainly did not mean that the cup was actually the new covenant, but that the cup <span style="font-style:italic;">represented</span> the new covenant.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, the Roman Catholic view fails to recognize the clear New Testament teaching on the <span style="font-style:italic;">finality</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">completeness</span> of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice once for all time for our sins: the book of Hebrews emphasizes this many times, as when it says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly</span> as the high priest enters the Holy Place yearly with blood not his own; for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared <span style="font-style:italic;">once</span> for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself … Christ, having been offered <span style="font-style:italic;">once</span> to bear the sins of many&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.25-28">Heb. 9:25&ndash;28</a>). To say that Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice continues or is repeated in the mass has been, since the Reformation, one of the most objectionable Roman Catholic doctrines from the standpoint of Protestants. When we realize that Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice for our sins is finished and completed (&ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">It is finished,</span>&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn19.30">John 19:30</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.3">Heb. 1:3</a>), it gives great assurance to us that our sins are all paid for, and there remains no sacrifice yet to be paid. But the idea of a continuation of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice destroys our assurance that the payment has been made by Christ and accepted by God the Father, and that there is &ldquo;no condemnation&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>) now remaining for us.

		For Protestants the idea that the mass is in any sense a repetition of the death of Christ seems to mark a return to the repeated sacrifices of the old covenant, which were &ldquo;a reminder of sin year after year&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.3">Heb. 10:3</a>). Instead of the assurance of complete forgiveness of sins through the once for all sacrifice of Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.12">Heb. 10:12</a>), the idea that the mass is a repeated sacrifice gives a constant reminder of sins and remaining guilt to be atoned for week after week.

		With regard to the teaching that only priests can officiate at the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the New Testament gives no instructions at all that place restrictions on the people who can preside at Communion. And since Scripture places no such restrictions on us, it would not seem to be justified to say that only priests can dispense the elements of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. Moreover, since the New Testament teaches that all believers are priests and members of a &ldquo;royal priesthood&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.9">1 Peter 2:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.16">Heb. 4:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.19-22">10:19&ndash;22</a>), we should not specify a certain class of people who have the rights of priests, as in the old covenant, but we should emphasize that all believers share the great spiritual privilege of coming near to God.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lutheran</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> View: Consubstantiation</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Martin Luther rejected the Roman Catholic view of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, yet he insisted that the phrase &ldquo;This is my body&rdquo; had to be taken in some sense as a literal statement. His conclusion was not that the bread actually <span style="font-style:italic;">becomes</span> the physical body of Christ, but that the physical body of Christ <span style="font-style:italic;">is present</span> &ldquo;in, with, and under&rdquo; the bread of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The example sometimes given is to say that Christ&rsquo;s body is present in the bread as water is present in a sponge&mdash;the water is not the sponge, but is present &ldquo;in, with, and under&rdquo; a sponge, and is present wherever the sponge is present. Other examples given are that of magnetism in a magnet or a soul in the body.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Lutheran understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is found in the textbook of Francis Pieper, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/chdogpie?pos=*CONTENTS*"><span style="font-style:italic;">Christian Dogmatics</span></a>. He quotes Luther&rsquo;s Small Catechism: &ldquo;What is the Sacrament of the Altar? It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, under the bread and wine, for us Christians to eat and to drink, instituted by Christ Himself.&rdquo; Similarly, the <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BookOfConcord.Ap:_art._x">Augsburg Confession, Article X</a>, says, &ldquo;Of the Supper of the Lord they teach that the Body and Blood of Christ are truly present, and are distributed to those who eat in the Supper of the Lord.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One passage that may be thought to give support to this position is <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.16">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>, &ldquo;The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, in order to affirm this doctrine, Luther had to answer an important question: How can Christ&rsquo;s physical body, or more generally Christ&rsquo;s human nature, be everywhere present? Is it not true that Jesus in his human nature ascended into heaven and remains there until his return? Did he not say that he was leaving the earth and would no longer be in the world but was going to the Father (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn16.28">John 16:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.11">17:11</a>)? In answer to this problem Luther taught the <span style="font-style:italic;">ubiquity</span> of Christ&rsquo;s human nature after his ascension&mdash;that is, that Christ&rsquo;s human nature was present everywhere (&ldquo;ubiquitous&rdquo;). But theologians ever since Luther&rsquo;s time have suspected that he taught the ubiquity of Christ&rsquo;s human nature, not because it is found anywhere in Scripture, but because he needed it to explain how his view of consubstantiation could be true.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In response to the Lutheran view, it can be said that it too fails to realize that Jesus is speaking of a <span style="font-style:italic;">spiritual</span> reality but using <span style="font-style:italic;">physical</span> objects to teach us when he says, &ldquo;This is my body.&rdquo; We should take this no more literally than we take the corresponding sentence, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">This cup</span> which is poured out for you <span style="font-style:italic;">is the new covenant</span> in my blood&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk22.20">Luke 22:20</a>). In fact, Luther does not really do justice to Jesus&rsquo; words in a literal sense at all. Berkhof rightly objects that Luther really makes the words of Jesus mean, &ldquo;This accompanies my body.&rdquo; In this matter it would help <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 995  </span>to read again <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.27-59">John 6:27&ndash;59</a>, where the context shows that Jesus is talking in literal, physical terms about bread, but he is continually explaining it in terms of spiritual reality.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. The Rest of Protestantism: A Symbolic and Spiritual Presence of Christ</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In distinction from Martin Luther, John Calvin and other Reformers argued that the bread and wine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper did not change into the body and blood of Christ, nor did they somehow contain the body and blood of Christ. Rather, the bread and wine <span style="font-style:italic;">symbolized</span> the body and blood of Christ, and they gave a visible sign of the fact that Christ himself was truly present. Calvin said:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		By the showing of the symbol the thing itself is also shown. For unless a man means to call God a deceiver, he would never dare assert that an empty symbol is set forth by him … And the godly ought by all means to keep this rule: whenever they see symbols appointed by the Lord, to think and be persuaded that the truth of the thing signified is surely present there. For why would the Lord put in your hand the symbol of his body, except to assure you of a true participation in it? (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/InstitutesOfTheChristianReligion.Institutes_IV,_xvii,_10"><span style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span></a><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/InstitutesOfTheChristianReligion.Institutes_IV,_xvii,_10"> 4.17.10</a>; p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/icrwjkc?ref=Page.p+1371">1371</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet Calvin was careful to differ both with Roman Catholic teaching (which said that the bread became Christ&rsquo;s body) and with Lutheran teaching (which said that the bread contained Christ&rsquo;s body).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But we must establish such a presence of Christ in the Supper as may neither fasten him to the element of bread, nor enclose him in bread, nor circumscribe him in any way (all which things, it is clear, detract from his heavenly glory). (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/InstitutesOfTheChristianReligion.Institutes_IV,_xvii,_19"><span style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span></a><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/InstitutesOfTheChristianReligion.Institutes_IV,_xvii,_19"> 4.17.19</a>; p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/icrwjkc?ref=Page.p+1381">1381</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Today most Protestants would say, in addition to the fact that the bread and wine symbolize the body and blood of Christ, that Christ is also <span style="font-style:italic;">spiritually present</span> in a special way as we partake of the bread and wine. Indeed, Jesus promised to be present whenever believers worship: &ldquo;Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.20">Matt. 18:20</a>). And if he is especially present when Christians gather to worship, then we would expect that he will be present in a special way in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper: We meet him at <span style="font-style:italic;">his</span> table, to which he comes to give himself to us. As we receive the elements of bread and wine in the presence of Christ, so we partake of him and all his benefits. We &ldquo;feed upon <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 996  </span>him in our hearts&rdquo; with thanksgiving. Indeed, even a child who knows Christ will understand this without being told and will expect to receive a special blessing from the Lord during this ceremony, because the meaning of it is so inherent in the very actions of eating and drinking. Yet we must not say that Christ is present apart from our personal faith, but only meets and blesses us there in accordance with our faith in him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In what way is Christ present then? Certainly there is a symbolic presence of Christ, but it is also a genuine spiritual presence and there is genuine spiritual blessing in this ceremony.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. Who Should Participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Despite differences over some aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, most Protestants would agree, first, that <span style="font-style:italic;">only those who believe in Christ</span> should participate in it, because it is a sign of being a Christian and continuing in the Christian life. Paul warns that those who eat and drink unworthily face serious consequences: &ldquo;For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.29-30">1 Cor. 11:29&ndash;30</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Second, many Protestants would argue from the meaning of baptism and the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper that, ordinarily, <span style="font-style:italic;">only those who have been baptized</span> should participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. This is because baptism is so clearly a symbol of <span style="font-style:italic;">beginning</span> the Christian life, while the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is clearly a symbol of <span style="font-style:italic;">continuing</span> the Christian life. Therefore if someone is taking the Lord&rsquo;s Supper and thereby giving public proclamation that he or she is continuing in the Christian life, then that person should be asked, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be good to be baptized now and thereby give a symbol that you are beginning the Christian life?&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But others, including the present author, would object to such a restriction as follows: A different problem arises if someone who is a genuine believer, but not yet baptized, is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> allowed to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper when Christians get together. In that case the person&rsquo;s nonparticipation symbolizes that he or she is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> a member of the body of Christ which is coming together to observe the Lord&rsquo;s Supper in a unified fellowship (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.17">1 Cor. 10:17</a>: &ldquo;Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo;). Therefore churches may think it best to allow non-baptized believers to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper but to urge them to be baptized as soon as possible. For if they are willing to participate in one outward symbol of being a Christian, there seems no reason why they should not be willing to participate in the other, a symbol that appropriately comes first.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Of course, the problems that arise in both situations (when unbaptized believers take Communion and when they do not) can all be avoided if new Christians are regularly baptized shortly after coming to faith. And, whichever position a church takes on the question of whether unbaptized believers should take Communion, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 997  </span>the teaching ministry of the church, it would seem wise to teach that the ideal situation is for new believers first to be baptized and then to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The third qualification for participation is that <span style="font-style:italic;">self-examination:</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. <span style="font-style:italic;">Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup</span>. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.27-29">1 Cor. 11:27&ndash;29</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the context of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11">1 Corinthians 11</a> Paul is rebuking the Corinthians for their selfish and inconsiderate conduct when they come together as a church: &ldquo;When you meet together, it is not the Lord&rsquo;s supper that you eat. For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.20-21">1 Cor. 11:20&ndash;21</a>). This helps us understand what Paul means when he talks about those who eat and drink &ldquo;without discerning the body&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.29">1 Cor. 11:29</a>). The problem at Corinth was <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> a failure to understand that the bread and cup represented the body and blood of the Lord&mdash;they certainly knew that. The problem rather was their selfish, inconsiderate conduct toward each other while they were at the Lord&rsquo;s table. They were not understanding or &ldquo;discerning&rdquo; the true nature of the church <span style="font-style:italic;">as one body</span>. This interpretation of &ldquo;without discerning the body&rdquo; is supported by Paul&rsquo;s mention of the church as the body of Christ just a bit earlier, in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.17">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>: &ldquo;Because there is one bread, we who are many <span style="font-style:italic;">are one</span> body, for we all partake of the one bread.&rdquo; So the phrase &ldquo;not discerning the <span style="font-style:italic;">body</span>&rdquo; means &ldquo;not understanding the unity and interdependence of people in the church, which is the body of Christ.&rdquo; It means not taking thought for our brothers and sisters when we come to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lord&rsquo;s</span> Supper, at which we ought to reflect his character.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What does it mean, then, to eat or drink &ldquo;in an unworthy manner&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.27">1 Cor. 11:27</a>)? We might at first think the words apply rather narrowly and pertain only to the way we conduct ourselves when we actually eat and drink the bread and wine. But when Paul explains that unworthy participation involves &ldquo;not discerning the body,&rdquo; he indicates that we are to take thought for all of our relationships within the body of Christ: are we acting in ways that vividly portray not the unity of the one bread and one body, but disunity? Are we conducting ourselves in ways that proclaim not the self-giving sacrifice of our Lord, but enmity and selfishness? In a broad sense, then, &ldquo;Let a man examine himself&rdquo; means that we ought to ask whether our relationships in the body of Christ are in fact reflecting the character of the Lord whom we meet there and whom we represent.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 998  </span>In this connection, Jesus&rsquo; teaching about coming to worship in general should also be mentioned:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.23-24">Matt. 5:23&ndash;24</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus here tells us that whenever we come to worship we should be sure that our relationships with others are right, and if they are not, we should act quickly to make them right and then come to worship God. This admonition ought to be especially true when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Of course, no pastor or church leader will know whether people are examining themselves or not (except in cases where clearly offensive or sinful conduct becomes evident to others). For the most part, the church must depend on the pastors and teachers to explain clearly the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper and to warn of the dangers of participating unworthily. Then people will have the responsibility to examine their own lives, in accordance with what Paul says. Indeed, Paul does not say that the pastors should examine everyone else&rsquo;s lives, but encourages individual self-examination instead: &ldquo;Let a man examine himself&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.28">1 Cor. 11:28</a>).

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Who should administer the Lord&rsquo;s Supper? Scripture gives no explicit teaching on this question, so we are left simply to decide what is wise and appropriate for the benefit of the believers in the church. In order to guard against abuse of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, a responsible leader ought to be in charge administering it, but it does not seem that Scripture requires that only ordained clergy or selected church officers could do this. In ordinary situations, of course, the pastor or other leader who ordinarily officiates at the worship services of the church would appropriately officiate at Communion as well. But beyond this, there would seem to be no reason why only officers or only leaders, or only men, should distribute the elements. Would it not speak much more clearly of our unity and spiritual equality in Christ if both men and women, for example, assisted in distributing the elements of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 999  </span>How often should the Lord&rsquo;s Supper be celebrated? Scripture does not tell us. Jesus simply said, &ldquo;As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.26">1 Cor. 11:26</a>). Paul&rsquo;s directive here regarding worship services would also be appropriate to consider: &ldquo;Let all things be done for edification&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.26">1 Cor. 14:26</a>). In actuality it has been the practice of most of the church throughout its history to celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s Supper every week when believers gather. However, in many Protestant groups since the Reformation, there has been a less frequent celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper&mdash;sometimes once a month or twice a month, or, in many Reformed churches, only four times a year. If the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is planned and explained and carried out in such a way that it is a time of self-examination, confession, and thanksgiving and praise, then it does not seem that celebrating it once a week would be too often, however, and it certainly could be observed that frequently &ldquo;for edification.&rdquo;

		This beautiful hymn is not frequently sung, but it speaks so directly to Jesus himself and speaks so clearly of the spiritual reality that we need to remember in the Lord&rsquo;s supper that it is one of the greatest hymns ever written regarding this doctrine. It conveys an attitude of reverence in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, joy in salvation, and genuine repentance for sin as well. The sweet beauty of spirit that Horatius Bonar exemplified in this hymn is matched by very few hymns in the history of the church.

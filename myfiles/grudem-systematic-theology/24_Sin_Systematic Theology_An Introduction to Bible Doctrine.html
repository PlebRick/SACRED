		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. The Definition of Sin</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The history of the human race as presented in Scripture is primarily a history of man in a state of sin and rebellion against God and of God&rsquo;s plan of redemption to bring man back to himself. Therefore, it is appropriate now to consider the nature of the sin that separates man from God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define sin as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">Sin is any failure to conform to the moral law of God in act, attitude, or nature</span>. Sin is here defined in relation to God and his moral law. Sin includes not only individual <span style="font-style:italic;">acts</span> such as stealing or lying or committing murder, but also <span style="font-style:italic;">attitudes</span> that are contrary to the attitudes God requires of us. We see this already in the Ten Commandments, which not only prohibit sinful actions but also wrong attitudes: &ldquo;You shall not covet your neighbor&rsquo;s house. You shall not covet your neighbor&rsquo;s wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex20.17">Ex. 20:17</a> NIV). Here God specifies that a desire to steal or to commit adultery is also sin in his sight. The Sermon on the Mount also prohibits sinful attitudes such as anger (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.22">Matt. 5:22</a>) or lust (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.28">Matt. 5:28</a>). Paul lists attitudes such as jealousy, anger, and selfishness (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.20">Gal. 5:20</a>) as things that are works of the flesh opposed to the desires of the Spirit (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.22">Gal. 5:22</a>). Therefore a life that is pleasing to God is one that has moral purity not only in its actions, but also in its desires of heart. In fact, the greatest commandment of all requires that our heart be filled with an attitude of love for God: &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk12.30">Mark 12:30</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The definition of sin given above specifies that sin is a failure to conform to God&rsquo;s moral law not only in <span style="font-style:italic;">action</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic;">attitude</span> but also in our <span style="font-style:italic;">moral nature</span>. Our very nature, the internal character that is the essence of who we are as persons, can also be sinful. Before we were redeemed by Christ, not only did we do sinful acts and have sinful attitudes, we were also sinners by nature. So Paul can say that &ldquo;while <span style="font-style:italic;">we were yet sinners</span> Christ died for us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.8">Rom. 5:8</a>), or that previously &ldquo;we were <span style="font-style:italic;">by nature</span> children of wrath, like the rest of mankind&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.3">Eph. 2:3</a>). Even while asleep, an unbeliever, though not committing sinful actions or <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 491  </span>actively nurturing sinful attitudes, is still a &ldquo;sinner&rdquo; in God&rsquo;s sight; he or she still has a sinful nature that does not conform to God&rsquo;s moral law.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Other definitions of the essential character of sin have been suggested. Probably the most common definition is to say that the essence of sin is selfishness. However, such a definition is unsatisfactory because (1) Scripture itself does not define sin this way. (2) Much self-interest is good and approved by Scripture, as when Jesus commands us to &ldquo;lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.20">Matt. 6:20</a>), or when we seek to grow in sanctification and Christian maturity (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.3">1 Thess. 4:3</a>), or even when we come to God through Christ for salvation. God certainly appeals to the self-interest of sinful people when he says, &ldquo;Turn back, turn back from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eze33.11">Ezek. 33:11</a>). To define the essential character of sin as selfishness will lead many people to think that they should abandon all desire for their own personal benefit, which is certainly contrary to Scripture. (3) Much sin is not selfishness in the ordinary sense of the term&mdash;people can show <span style="font-style:italic;">selfless</span> devotion to a false religion or to secular and humanistic educational or political goals that are contrary to Scripture, yet these would not be due to &ldquo;selfishness&rdquo; in any ordinary sense of the word. Moreover, hatred of God, idolatry, and unbelief are not generally due to selfishness, but they are very serious sins. (4) Such a definition could suggest that there was wrongdoing or sinfulness even on God&rsquo;s part, since God&rsquo;s highest goal is to seek his own glory (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is42.8">Isa. 42:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.7">43:7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.21">21</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.12">Eph. 1:12</a>). But such a conclusion is clearly wrong.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is far better to define sin in the way Scripture does, in relationship to God&rsquo;s law and his moral character. John tells us that &ldquo;sin is lawlessness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.4">1 John 3:4</a>). When Paul seeks to demonstrate the universal sinfulness of mankind, he appeals to the law of God, whether the written law given to the Jew (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.17-29">Rom. 2:17&ndash;29</a>) or the unwritten law that operates in the consciences of Gentiles who, by their behavior, &ldquo;show that what the law requires is written on their hearts&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.15">Rom. 2:15</a>). In each case their sinfulness is demonstrated by their lack of conformity to the moral law of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 492  </span>Finally, we should note that this definition emphasizes the seriousness of sin. We realize from experience that sin is harmful to our lives, that it brings pain and destructive consequences to us and to others affected by it. But to define sin as failure to conform to the moral law of God, is to say that sin is more than simply painful and destructive&mdash;it is also <span style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span> in the deepest sense of the word. In a universe created by God, <span style="font-style:italic;">sin ought not to be</span>. Sin is directly opposite to all that is good in the character of God, and just as God necessarily and eternally delights in himself and in all that he is, so God necessarily and eternally hates sin. It is, in essence, the contradiction of the excellence of his moral character. It contradicts his holiness, and he must hate it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. The Origin of Sin</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Where did sin come from? How did it come into the universe? First, we must clearly affirm that God himself did not sin, and God is not to be blamed for sin. It was man who sinned, and it was angels who sinned, and in both cases they did so by willful, voluntary choice. To blame God for sin would be blasphemy against the character of God. &ldquo;His work is perfect; for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt32.4">Deut. 32:4</a>). Abraham asks with truth and force in his words, &ldquo;Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge18.25">Gen. 18:25</a>). And Elihu rightly says, &ldquo;Far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job34.10">Job 34:10</a>). In fact, it is impossible for God even to desire to do wrong: &ldquo;God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.13">James 1:13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet, on the other hand, we must guard against an opposite error: it would be wrong for us to say there is an eternally existing evil power in the universe similar to or equal to God himself in power. To say this would be to affirm what is called an ultimate &ldquo;dualism&rdquo; in the universe, the existence of two equally ultimate powers, one good and the other evil. Also, we must never think that sin surprised God or challenged or overcame his omnipotence or his providential control over the universe. Therefore, even though we must never say that God himself sinned or he is to be blamed for sin, yet we must also affirm that the God who &ldquo;accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.11">Eph. 1:11</a>), the God who &ldquo;does according to his will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Da4.35">Dan. 4:35</a>) did ordain that sin would come into the world, even though he does not delight in it and even though he ordained that it would come about through the voluntary choices of moral creatures.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Even before the disobedience of Adam and Eve, sin was present in the angelic world with the fall of Satan and demons. But with respect to the human race, the first sin was that of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.1-19">Gen. 3:1&ndash;19</a>). Their eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is in many ways <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 493  </span>typical of sin generally. First, their sin struck at the basis for knowledge, for it gave a different answer to the question, &ldquo;What is true?&rdquo; Whereas God had said that Adam and Eve would die if they ate from the tree (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.17">Gen. 2:17</a>), the serpent said, &ldquo;You will not die&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.4">Gen. 3:4</a>). Eve decided to doubt the veracity of God&rsquo;s word and conduct an experiment to see whether God spoke truthfully.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Second, their sin struck at the basis for moral standards, for it gave a different answer to the question &ldquo;What is right?&rdquo; God had said that it was morally right for Adam and Eve not to eat from the fruit of that one tree (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.17">Gen. 2:17</a>). But the serpent suggested that it would be right to eat of the fruit, and that in eating it Adam and Eve would become &ldquo;like God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.5">Gen. 3:5</a>). Eve trusted her own evaluation of what was right and what would be good for her, rather than allowing God&rsquo;s words to define right and wrong. She &ldquo;saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,&rdquo; and therefore she &ldquo;took of its fruit and ate&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.6">Gen. 3:6</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Third, their sin gave a different answer to the question, &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; The correct answer was that Adam and Eve were creatures of God, dependent on him and always to be subordinate to him as their Creator and Lord. But Eve, and then Adam, succumbed to the temptation to &ldquo;be like God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.5">Gen. 3:5</a>), thus attempting to put themselves in the place of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is important to insist on the historical truthfulness of the narrative of the fall of Adam and Eve. Just as the account of the creation of Adam and Eve is tied in with the rest of the historical narrative in the book of Genesis, so also this account of the fall of man, which follows the history of man&rsquo;s creation, is presented by the author as straightforward, narrative history. Moreover, the New Testament authors look back on this account and affirm that &ldquo;sin came into the world through one man&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.12">Rom. 5:12</a>) and insist that &ldquo;the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.16">Rom. 5:16</a>) and that &ldquo;the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.3">2 Cor. 11:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.14">1 Tim. 2:14</a>). The serpent was no doubt, a real, physical serpent, but one that was talking because of the empowerment of Satan speaking through it (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge3.15">Gen. 3:15</a> with <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro16.20">Rom. 16:20</a>; also <a href="https://ref.ly/Nu22.28-30">Num. 22:28&ndash;30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.9">Rev. 12:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.2">20:2</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, we should note that all sin is ultimately irrational. It really did not make sense for Satan to rebel against God in the expectation of being able to exalt himself above God. Nor did it make sense for Adam and Eve to think that there could be any gain in disobeying the words of their Creator. These were foolish choices. The persistence of Satan in rebelling against God even today is still a foolish choice, as is the decision on the part of any human being to continue in a state of rebellion against God. It is not the wise man but &ldquo;the fool&rdquo; who &ldquo;says in his heart, &ldquo;There is no God&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps14.1">Ps. 14:1</a>). It is the &ldquo;fool&rdquo; in the book of Proverbs who recklessly indulges in all kinds of sins (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr10.23">Prov. 10:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr12.15">12:15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr14.7">14:7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr14.16">16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr15.5">15:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr18.2">18:2</a>; et al.). Though people sometimes persuade themselves that they have good reasons for sinning, when examined in the cold light of truth on the last day, it will be seen in every case that sin ultimately just does not make sense.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 494  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">C. THE DOCTRINE OF INHERITED SIN</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		How does the sin of Adam affect us? Scripture teaches that we inherit sin from Adam in two ways.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Inherited Guilt: We Are Counted Guilty Because of Adam&rsquo;s Sin</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Paul explains the effects of Adam&rsquo;s sin in the following way: &ldquo;Therefore … sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.12">Rom. 5:12</a>). The context shows that Paul is not talking about actual sins that people commit every day of their lives, for the entire paragraph (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.12-21">Rom. 5:12&ndash;21</a>) is taken up with the comparison between Adam and Christ. And when Paul says, &ldquo;so [Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">οὕτως</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4048">G4048</a>, &ldquo;thus, in this way&rdquo;; that is, through Adam&rsquo;s sin] death spread to all men because all men sinned,&rdquo; he is saying that through the sin of Adam &ldquo;all men sinned.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This idea, that &ldquo;all men sinned&rdquo; means that God thought of us all as having sinned when Adam disobeyed, is further indicated by the next two verses, where Paul says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.13-14">Rom. 5:13&ndash;14</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here Paul points out that from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, people did not have God&rsquo;s written laws. Though their sins were &ldquo;not counted&rdquo; (as infractions of the law), they still died. The fact that they died is very good proof that God counted people guilty on the basis of Adam&rsquo;s sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The idea that God counted us guilty because of Adam&rsquo;s sin is further affirmed in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.18-19">Romans 5:18&ndash;19</a>:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then as one man&rsquo;s trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man&rsquo;s act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men. For as <span style="font-style:italic;">by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners</span> so by one man&rsquo;s obedience many will be made righteous.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here Paul says explicitly that through the trespass of one man &ldquo;many were made [Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">κατεστάθησαν</span> from <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">καθίστημι</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2770">G2770</a>, also an aorist indicative indicating completed past action] sinners.&rdquo; When Adam sinned, God thought of all who would descend from Adam <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 495  </span>as sinners. Though we did not yet exist, God, looking into the future and knowing that we would exist, began thinking of us as those who were guilty like Adam. This is also consistent with Paul&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;while we were yet sinners Christ died for us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.8">Rom. 5:8</a>). Of course, some of us did not even exist when Christ died. But God nevertheless regarded us as sinners in need of salvation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The conclusion to be drawn from these verses is that all members of the human race were represented by Adam in the time of testing in the Garden of Eden. As our representative, Adam sinned, and God counted us guilty as well as Adam. (A technical term that is sometimes used in this connection is <span style="font-style:italic;">imput</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span> meaning &ldquo;to think of as belonging to someone, and therefore to cause it to belong to that person.&rdquo;) God counted Adam&rsquo;s guilt as belonging to us, and since God is the ultimate judge of all things in the universe, and since his thoughts are always true, Adam&rsquo;s guilt does in fact belong to us. God rightly imputed Adam&rsquo;s guilt to us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Sometimes the doctrine of inherited sin from Adam is termed the doctrine of &ldquo;original sin.&rdquo; As explained above, I have not used this expression. If this term is used, it should be remembered that the sin spoken of does not refer to Adam&rsquo;s first sin, but to the guilt and tendency to sin with which we are born. It is &ldquo;original&rdquo; in that it comes from Adam, and it is also original in that we have it from the beginning of our existence as persons, but it is still our sin, not Adam&rsquo;s sin, that is meant. Parallel to the phrase &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; is the phrase &ldquo;original guilt.&rdquo; This is that aspect of inherited sin from Adam that we have been discussing above, namely, the idea that we inherit the guilt from Adam.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we first confront the idea that we have been counted guilty because of Adam&rsquo;s sin, our tendency is to protest because it seems unfair. We did not actually decide to sin, did we? Then how can we be counted guilty? Is it just for God to act this way?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In response, three things may be said: (1) Everyone who protests that this is unfair has also voluntarily committed many actual sins for which God also holds us guilty. These will constitute the primary basis of our judgment on the last day, for God &ldquo;will render to every man <span style="font-style:italic;">according to his works</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.6">Rom. 2:6</a>), and &ldquo;the wrongdoer will be paid back <span style="font-style:italic;">for the wrong he has done</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.25">Col. 3:25</a>). (2) Moreover, some have argued, &ldquo;If any one of us were in Adam&rsquo;s place, we also would have sinned as he did, and our subsequent rebellion against God demonstrates that.&rdquo; I think this is probably true, but it does not seem to be a conclusive argument, for it assumes too much about what would or would not happen. Such uncertainty may not help very much to lessen someone&rsquo;s sense of unfairness.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(3) The most persuasive answer to the objection is to point out that if we think it is unfair for us to be represented by Adam, then we should also think it is unfair for us to be represented by Christ and to have his righteousness imputed to us by God. For the procedure that God used was just the same, and that is exactly Paul&rsquo;s point in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.12-21">Romans 5:12&ndash;21</a>: &ldquo;As by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man&rsquo;s obedience many will be made righteous&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.19">Rom. 5:19</a>). Adam, our first representative sinned&mdash;and God counted us guilty. But Christ, the representative of all who believe in him, obeyed God perfectly&mdash;and God counted us righteous. That is simply the way in which God set up the human race to work. God regards the human race as an organic whole, a unity, represented by <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 496  </span>Adam as its head. And God also thinks of the new race of Christians, those who are redeemed by Christ, as an organic whole, a unity represented by Christ as head of his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Not all evangelical theologians, however, agree that we are counted guilty because of Adam&rsquo;s sin. Some, especially Arminian theologians, think this to be unfair of God and do not believe that it is taught in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5">Romans 5</a>. However, evangelicals of all persuasions do agree that we receive a sinful disposition or a tendency to sin as an inheritance from Adam, a subject we shall now consider.

Inherited Corruption: We Have a Sinful Nature Because of Adam&rsquo;s Sin</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In addition to the legal guilt that God imputes to us because of Adam&rsquo;s sin, we also inherit a sinful nature because of Adam&rsquo;s sin. This inherited sinful nature is sometimes simply called &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; and sometimes more precisely called &ldquo;original pollution.&rdquo; I have used instead the term &ldquo;inherited corruption&rdquo; because it seems to express more clearly the specific idea in view.

		David says, &ldquo;Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps51.5">Ps. 51:5</a>). Some have mistakenly thought that the sin of David&rsquo;s mother is in view here, but this is incorrect, for the entire context has nothing to do with David&rsquo;s mother. David is confessing his own personal sin throughout this section. He says:

		David is so overwhelmed with the consciousness of his own sin that as he looks back on his life he realizes that he was sinful from the beginning. As far back as he can think of himself, he realizes that he has had a sinful nature. In fact, when he was born or &ldquo;brought forth&rdquo; from his mother&rsquo;s womb, he was &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">brought forth</span> in iniquity&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps51.5">Ps. 51:5</a>). Moreover, even before he was born, he had a sinful disposition: he affirms that at the moment of conception he had a sinful nature, for &ldquo;in sin did my mother <span style="font-style:italic;">conceive</span> me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps51.5">Ps. 51:5</a>). Here is a strong statement of the inherent tendency to sin that attaches to our lives from the very beginning. A similar idea is affirmed in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps58.3">Psalm 58:3</a>, &ldquo;The wicked go astray from the womb, they err from their birth, speaking lies.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore, our nature includes a disposition to sin so that Paul can affirm that before we were Christians &ldquo;we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.3">Eph. 2:3</a>). Anyone who has raised children can give experiential testimony to the fact that we are all born with a tendency to sin. Children do not have to be taught how to do wrong; they discover that by themselves. What we have to do as parents is to teach them how to do right, to &ldquo;bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.4">Eph. 6:4</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This inherited tendency to sin does not mean that human beings are all as bad as they could be. The constraints of civil law, the expectations of family and society, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 497  </span>and the conviction of human conscience (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.14-15">Rom. 2:14&ndash;15</a>) all provide restraining influences on the sinful tendencies in our hearts. Therefore, by God&rsquo;s &ldquo;common grace&rdquo; (that is, by his undeserved favor that is given to all human beings), people have been able to do much good in the areas of education, the development of civilization, scientific and technological progress, the development of beauty and skill in the arts, the development of just laws, and general acts of human benevolence and kindness to others. In fact, the more Christian influence there is in a society in general, the more clearly the influence of &ldquo;common grace&rdquo; will be seen in the lives of unbelievers as well. But in spite of the ability to do good in many senses of that word, our inherited corruption, our tendency to sin, which we received from Adam, means that as far as God is concerned we are not able to do anything that pleases him. This may be seen in two ways:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. In Our Natures We Totally Lack Spiritual Good Before God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> It is not just that some parts of us are sinful and others are pure. Rather, every part of our being is affected by sin&mdash;our intellects, our emotions and desires, our hearts (the center of our desires and decision-making processes), our goals and motives, and even our physical bodies. Paul says, &ldquo;I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro7.18">Rom. 7:18</a>), and, &ldquo;to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are corrupted&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.15">Titus 1:15</a>). Moreover, Jeremiah tells us that &ldquo;the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can understand it?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je17.9">Jer. 17:9</a>). In these passages Scripture is not denying that unbelievers can do good in human society <span style="font-style:italic;">in some senses</span>. But it is denying that they can do any <span style="font-style:italic;">spiritual</span> good or be good <span style="font-style:italic;">in terms of a relationship with God</span>. Apart from the work of Christ in our lives, we are like all other unbelievers who are &ldquo;darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.18">Eph. 4:18</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. In Our Actions We Are Totally Unable to Do Spiritual Good Before God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> This idea is related to the previous one. Not only do we as sinners lack any spiritual good in ourselves, but we also lack the ability to do anything that will in itself please God and the ability to come to God in our own strength. Paul says that &ldquo;those who are in the flesh <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot please God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.8">Rom. 8:8</a>). Moreover, in terms of bearing fruit for God&rsquo;s kingdom and doing what pleases him, Jesus says, &ldquo;Apart from me you can do nothing&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.5">John 15:5</a>). In fact, unbelievers are not pleasing to God, if for no other reason, simply because their actions do not proceed from faith in God or from love to him, and &ldquo;without faith it is impossible to please him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11.6">Heb. 11:6</a>). When Paul&rsquo;s readers were unbelievers, he tells them, &ldquo;You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once walked&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.1-2">Eph. 2:1&ndash;2</a>). Unbelievers are in a state of bondage or enslavement to sin, because &ldquo;every one who commits sin is a slave to sin&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn8.34">John 8:34</a>). Though from a human standpoint <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 498  </span>people might be able to do much good, Isaiah affirms that &ldquo;all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is64.6">Isa. 64:6</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.9-20">Rom. 3:9&ndash;20</a>). Unbelievers are not even able to understand the things of God correctly, for the &ldquo;natural man does not receive the gifts [lit. &ldquo;things&rsquo;] of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co2.14">1 Cor. 2:14</a> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">rsv</span> mg.). Nor can we come to God in our own power, for Jesus says, &ldquo;No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.44">John 6:44</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But if we have a total inability to do any spiritual good in God&rsquo;s sight, then do we still have any freedom of choice? Certainly, those who are outside of Christ do still make voluntary choices&mdash;that is, they decide what they want to do, then they do it. In this sense there is still a kind of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; in the choices that people make. Yet because of their inability to do good and to escape from their fundamental rebellion against God and their fundamental preference for sin, unbelievers do not have freedom in the most important sense of freedom&mdash;that is, the freedom to do right, and to do what is pleasing to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The application to our lives is quite evident: if God gives anyone a desire to repent and trust in Christ, he or she should not delay and should not harden his or her heart (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.7-8">Heb. 3:7&ndash;8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.17">12:17</a>). This ability to repent and desire to trust in God is not naturally ours but is given by the prompting of the Holy Spirit, and it will not last forever. &ldquo;Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.15">Heb. 3:15</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. All People Are Sinful Before God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture in many places testifies to the universal sinfulness of mankind. &ldquo;They have all gone astray, they are all alike corrupt; there is none that does good, no, not one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps14.3">Ps. 14:3</a>). David says, &ldquo;No man living is righteous before you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps143.2">Ps. 143:2</a>). And Solomon says, &ldquo;There is no man who does not sin&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ki8.46">1 Kings 8:46</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr20.9">Prov. 20:9</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the New Testament, Paul has an extensive argument in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.18-3.20">Romans 1:18&ndash;3:20</a> showing that all people, both Jews and Greeks, stand guilty before God. He says, &ldquo;All men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin, as it is written: &ldquo;None is righteous, no, not one&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.9-10">Rom. 3:9&ndash;10</a>). He is certain that &ldquo;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.23">Rom. 3:23</a>). James, the Lord&rsquo;s brother, admits, &ldquo;We all make many mistakes&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas3.2">James 3:2</a>), and if he, as a leader and an apostle in the early church, could admit that he made many mistakes, then we also should be willing to admit that of ourselves. John, the beloved disciple, who was especially close to Jesus, said:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn1.8-10">1 John 1:8&ndash;10</a>)

Does Our Ability Limit Our Responsibility?</span> Pelagius, a popular Christian teacher active in Rome about <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 383&ndash;410 and then later (until <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 424) in Palestine, taught that God holds man responsible only for those things that man is <span style="font-style:italic;">able</span> to do. Since God warns us to do good, therefore, we must have the ability to do the good that God commands. The Pelagian position rejects the doctrine of &ldquo;inherited sin&rdquo; (or &ldquo;original sin&rdquo;) and maintains that sin consists only in separate sinful acts.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, the idea that we are responsible before God only for what we are able to do is contrary to the testimony of Scripture, which affirms both that we &ldquo;were <span style="font-style:italic;">dead</span> through the trespasses and sins&rdquo; in which we once walked (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.1">Eph. 2:1</a>), and thus unable to do any spiritual good, and also that we are all guilty before God. Moreover, if our responsibility before God were limited by our ability, then extremely hardened sinners, who are in great bondage to sin, could be less guilty before God than mature Christians who were striving daily to obey him. And Satan himself, who is eternally able to do only evil, would have no guilt at all&mdash;surely an incorrect conclusion.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The true measure of our responsibility and guilt is not our own ability to obey God, but rather the absolute perfection of God&rsquo;s moral law and his own holiness (which is reflected in that law). &ldquo;You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.48">Matt. 5:48</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Are Infants Guilty Before They Commit Actual Sins?</span> Some maintain that Scripture teaches an &ldquo;age of accountability&rdquo; before which young children are not held responsible for sin and are not counted guilty before God. However, the passages noted above in Section <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.3.24.1.3.0.0.0">C</a> about &ldquo;inherited sin&rdquo; indicate that even before birth children have a guilty standing before God and a sinful nature that not only gives them a tendency to sin but also causes God to view them as &ldquo;sinners.&rdquo; &ldquo;Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps51.5">Ps. 51:5</a>). The passages that speak of final judgment in terms of actual sinful deeds that have been done (e.g., <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.6-11">Rom. 2:6&ndash;11</a>) do not say anything about the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 500  </span>basis of judgment when there have been no individual actions of right or wrong, as with children dying in early infancy. In such cases we must accept the Scriptures that talk about ourselves as having a sinful nature from before the time of birth. Furthermore, we must realize that a child&rsquo;s sinful nature manifests itself very early, certainly within the first two years of a child&rsquo;s life, as anyone who has raised children can affirm. (David says, in another place, &ldquo;The wicked go astray <span style="font-style:italic;">from the womb</span> they err <span style="font-style:italic;">from their birth,</span>&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps58.3">Ps. 58:3</a>.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But then what do we say about infants who die before they are old enough to understand and believe the gospel? Can they be saved?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here we must say that if such infants are saved, it cannot be on their own merits, or on the basis of their own righteousness or innocence, but it must be entirely on the basis of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work and regeneration by the work of the Holy Spirit within them. &ldquo;There is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.5">1 Tim. 2:5</a>). &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.3">John 3:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet it certainly is possible for God to bring regeneration (that is, new spiritual life) to an infant even before he or she is born. This was true of John the Baptist, for the angel Gabriel, before John was born, said, &ldquo;He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, <span style="font-style:italic;">even from his mother&rsquo;s womb</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk1.15">Luke 1:15</a>). We might say that John the Baptist was &ldquo;born again&rdquo; before he was born! There is a similar example in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22.10">Psalm 22:10</a>: David says, &ldquo;Since my mother bore me you have been my God.&rdquo; It is clear, therefore, that God is able to save infants in an unusual way, apart from their hearing and understanding the gospel, by bringing regeneration to them very early, sometimes even before birth. This regeneration is probably also followed at once by a nascent, intuitive awareness of God and trust in him at an extremely early age, but this is something we simply cannot understand.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We must, however, affirm very clearly that this is not the usual way for God to save people. Salvation usually occurs when someone hears and understands the gospel and then places trust in Christ. But in unusual cases like John the Baptist, God brought salvation before this understanding. And this leads us to conclude that it certainly is possible that God would also do this where he knows the infant will die before hearing the gospel.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		How many infants does God save in this way? Scripture does not tell us, so we simply cannot know. Where Scripture is silent, it is unwise for us to make definitive pronouncements. However, we should recognize that it is God&rsquo;s frequent pattern throughout Scripture to save the children of those who believe in him (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge7.1">Gen. 7:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11.7">Heb. 11:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jos2.18">Josh. 2:18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.17">Ps. 103:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.53">John 4:53</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.39">Acts 2:39</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac11.14">11:14</a>(?); <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.31">16:31</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac18.8">18:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.16">1 Cor. 1:16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co7.14">7:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Tt1.6">Titus 1:6</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.10">Matt. 18:10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.14">14</a>). These passages do not show that God automatically saves the children of all believers (for we all know of children of godly parents who have grown up and rejected the Lord, and Scripture also gives such examples as Esau and Absalom), but they do indicate that God&rsquo;s ordinary pattern, the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or expected way in which he acts, is to bring the children of believers to himself. With regard to believers&rsquo; children who die very young, we have no reason to think that it would be otherwise.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 501  </span>Particularly relevant here is the case of the first child Bathsheba bore to King David. When the infant child had died, David said, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I shall go to him</span> but he will not return to me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Sa12.23">2 Sam. 12:23</a>). David, who through his life had such great confidence that he would live forever in the Lord&rsquo;s presence (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps23.6">Ps. 23:6</a>, and many of David&rsquo;s psalms), also had confidence that he would see his infant son again when he died. This can only imply that he would be with his son in the presence of the Lord forever. This passage, together with the others mentioned above, should be of similar assurance to all believers who have lost children in their infancy, that they will one day see them again in the glory of the heavenly kingdom.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Regarding the children of unbelievers who die at a very early age Scripture is silent. We simply must leave that matter in the hands of God and trust him to be both just and merciful. If they are saved, it will not be on the basis of any merit of their own or any innocence that we might presume that they have. If they are saved, it will be on the basis of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming work; and their regeneration, like that of John the Baptist before he was born, will be by God&rsquo;s mercy and grace. Salvation is always because of his mercy, not because of our merits (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.14-18">Rom. 9:14&ndash;18</a>). Scripture does not allow us to say more than that.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Legal Guilt</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> In terms of our legal standing before God, any one sin, even what may seem to be a very small one, makes us legally guilty before God and therefore worthy of eternal punishment. Adam and Eve learned this in the Garden of Eden, where God told them that one act of disobedience would result in the penalty of death (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge2.17">Gen. 2:17</a>). And Paul affirms that &ldquo;the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.16">Rom. 5:16</a>). This one sin made Adam and Eve sinners before God, no longer able to stand in his holy presence.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This truth remains valid through the history of the human race. Paul (quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt27.26">Deut. 27:26</a>) affirms it: &ldquo;Cursed be every one who does not abide by <span style="font-style:italic;">all things</span> written in the book of the law, and do them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.10">Gal. 3:10</a>). And James declares:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Whoever keeps the whole law but fails <span style="font-style:italic;">in one point</span> has become guilty of all of it. For he who said, &ldquo;Do not commit adultery,&rdquo; said also, &ldquo;Do not kill.&rdquo; If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Results in Life and in Relationship With God</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> On the other hand, some sins are worse than others in that they have more harmful consequences in our lives and in the lives of others, and, in terms of our personal relationship to God as Father, they arouse his displeasure more and bring more serious disruption to our fellowship with him.

		Scripture sometimes speaks of degrees of seriousness of sin. When Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate, he said, &ldquo;he who delivered me to you has the <span style="font-style:italic;">greater sin</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn19.11">John 19:11</a>). The reference is apparently to Judas, who had known Jesus intimately for three years and yet willfully betrayed him to death. Though Pilate had authority over Jesus by virtue of his governmental office and was wrong to allow an innocent man to be condemned to death, the sin of Judas was far &ldquo;greater,&rdquo; probably because of the far greater knowledge and malice connected with it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When God showed Ezekiel visions of sins in the temple of Jerusalem, he first showed Ezekiel certain things, then said, &ldquo;But you will see <span style="font-style:italic;">still greater</span> abominations&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eze8.6">Ezek. 8:6</a>). Next he showed Ezekiel the secret sins of some of the elders of Israel and said, &ldquo;You will see <span style="font-style:italic;">still greater</span> abominations which they commit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eze8.13">Ezek. 8:13</a>). Then the Lord showed Ezekiel a picture of women weeping for a Babylonian deity and said, &ldquo;Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see <span style="font-style:italic;">still greater</span> abominations than these&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eze8.15">Ezek. 8:15</a>). Finally, he showed Ezekiel twenty-five men in the temple, with their backs to the Lord and worshiping the sun instead. Here clearly we have degrees of increasing sin and hatefulness before God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the Sermon of the Mount, when Jesus says, &ldquo;Whoever then relaxes one of <span style="font-style:italic;">the least of these commandments</span> and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt5.19">Matt. 5:19</a>), he implies that there are lesser and greater commandments. Similarly, though he agrees that it is appropriate to give a tithe even on the household spices that people use, he pronounces woes on the Pharisees for neglecting &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the weightier matters of the law</span> justice and mercy and faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt23.23">Matt. 23:23</a>). In both cases Jesus distinguishes between lesser and greater commandments, thus implying that some sins are worse than other sins in terms of God&rsquo;s own evaluation of their importance.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In general, we may say that some sins have more harmful consequences than others if they bring more dishonor to God or if they cause more harm to ourselves, to others, or to the church. Moreover, those sins that are done willfully, repeatedly, and knowingly, with a calloused heart, are more displeasing to God than those that are done out of ignorance and are not repeated, or are done with a mixture of good and impure motives and are followed by remorse and repentance. Thus the laws that God gave to Moses in Leviticus make provisions for cases where people sin &ldquo;unwittingly&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Le4.2">Lev. 4:2</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Le4.13">13</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Le4.22">22</a>). Unintentional sin is still sin: &ldquo;If any one sins, doing any of the things which the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> has commanded not to be done, though he does not know it, yet he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity&rdquo; <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 503  </span>(<a href="https://ref.ly/Le5.17">Lev. 5:17</a>). Nonetheless, the penalties required and the degree of God&rsquo;s displeasure that results from the sin are less than in the case of intentional sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, sins committed with &ldquo;a high hand,&rdquo; that is, with arrogance and disdain for God&rsquo;s commandments, were viewed very seriously: &ldquo;But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native or a sojourner, reviles the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, and that person shall be cut off from among his people&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Nu15.30">Num. 15:30</a>; cf. vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Nu15.27-29">27&ndash;29</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We can readily see how some sins have much more harmful consequences for ourselves and others and for our relationship with God. If I were to covet my neighbor&rsquo;s car, that would be sin before God. But if my coveting led me to actually steal the car, that would be more serious sin. If in the course of stealing the car I also fought with my neighbor and injured him or recklessly injured someone else as I drove the car, that would be even more serious sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, if a new Christian, who previously had a tendency to lose his temper and get into fights, begins witnessing to his unbelieving friends and, one day, is so provoked he loses his temper and actually strikes someone, that is certainly sin in God&rsquo;s sight. But if a mature pastor or other prominent Christian leader were to lose his temper publicly and strike someone, that would be even more serious in God&rsquo;s sight, both because of the harm that would come to the reputation of the gospel and because those in leadership positions are held to a higher standard of accountability by God: &ldquo;We who teach shall be judged with greater strictness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas3.1">James 3:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk12.48">Luke 12:48</a>). Our conclusion, then, is that in terms of <span style="font-style:italic;">results</span> and in terms of the <span style="font-style:italic;">degree of God&rsquo;s displeasure</span> some sins are certainly worse than others.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, the distinction between degrees of seriousness of sin does not imply an endorsement of the Roman Catholic teaching that sins can be put into the two categories of &ldquo;venial&rdquo; and &ldquo;mortal.&rdquo; In Roman Catholic teaching, a venial sin can be forgiven, but often after punishments in this life or in Purgatory (after death, but before entrance into heaven). A mortal sin is a sin that causes spiritual death and cannot be forgiven; it excludes people from the kingdom of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		According to Scripture, however, all sins are &ldquo;mortal&rdquo; in that even the smallest sin makes us legally guilty before God and worthy of eternal punishment. Yet even the most serious of sins are forgiven when one comes to Christ for salvation (note the combination of a list of sins that exclude from the kingdom of God and the affirmation that the Corinthians who had committed them have been saved by Christ in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.9-11">1 Cor. 6:9&ndash;11</a>). Thus, in that sense, all sins are &ldquo;venial.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic separation of sins into the category of &ldquo;mortal&rdquo; and &ldquo;venial,&rdquo; calling some sins (such as suicide) &ldquo;mortal,&rdquo; while calling others (such as dishonesty, anger, or <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 504  </span>lust) &ldquo;venial&rdquo; sins can very easily lead either to carelessness with respect to some sins that greatly hinder sanctification and effectiveness in the Lord&rsquo;s work, or, with respect to other sins, to excessive fear, despair, and inability ever to have assurance of forgiveness. And we should realize that the same exact action (such as losing one&rsquo;s temper and striking someone in the example above) can be more or less serious, depending on the person and circumstances involved. It is much better simply to recognize that sins can vary in terms of their results and in terms of the degree to which they disrupt our relationship with God and incur his displeasure, and leave it at that. Then we do not go beyond the general teaching of Scripture on this subject.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The distinction that Scripture makes in degrees of sin does have positive value. First, it helps us to know where we should put more effort in our own attempts to grow in personal holiness. Second, it helps us to decide when we should simply overlook a minor fault in a friend or family member and when it would be appropriate to talk with an individual about some evident sin (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.19-20">James 5:19&ndash;20</a>). Third, it may help us decide when church discipline is appropriate, and it provides an answer to the objection that is sometimes raised against exercising church discipline, in which it is said that &ldquo;we are all guilty of sin, so we have no business meddling in anyone else&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; Though we are all indeed guilty of sin, nonetheless, there are some sins that so evidently harm the church and relationships within the church that they must be dealt with directly. Fourth, this distinction may also help us realize that there is some basis for civil governments to have laws and penalties prohibiting certain kinds of wrongdoing (such as murder or stealing), but not other kinds of wrongdoing (such as anger, jealousy, greed, or selfish use of one&rsquo;s possessions). It is not inconsistent to say that some kinds of wrongdoing require civil punishment but not all kinds of wrongdoing require it.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. What Happens When a Christian Sins?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Our Legal Standing Before God Is Unchanged</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Though this subject could be treated later in relation to adoption or sanctification within the Christian life, it is quite appropriate to treat it at this point.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When a Christian sins, his or her legal standing before God is unchanged. He or she is still forgiven, for &ldquo;there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>). Salvation is not based on our merits but is a free gift of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.23">Rom. 6:23</a>), and Christ&rsquo;s death certainly paid for all our sins&mdash;past, present, and future&mdash;Christ died &ldquo;for our sins&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.3">1 Cor. 15:3</a>), without distinction. In theological terms, we still keep our &ldquo;justification.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, we are still children of God and we still retain our membership in God&rsquo;s family. In the same epistle in which John says, &ldquo;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth in not in us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn1.8">1 John 1:8</a>), he also reminds his readers, &ldquo;Beloved, we are God&rsquo;s children now&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.2">1 John 3:2</a>). The fact that we have sin remaining in our lives does not mean that we lose our status as God&rsquo;s children. In theological terms, we keep our &ldquo;adoption.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 505  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Our Fellowship With God Is Disrupted and Our Christian Life Is Damaged</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> When we sin, even though God does not cease to love us, he is displeased with us. (Even among human beings, it is possible to love someone and be displeased with that person at the same time, as any parent will attest, or any wife, or any husband.) Paul tells us that it is possible for Christians to &ldquo;grieve the Holy Spirit of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.30">Eph. 4:30</a>); when we sin, we cause him sorrow and he is displeased with us. The author of Hebrews reminds us that &ldquo;the Lord disciplines him whom he loves&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.6">Heb. 12:6</a>, quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr3.11-12">Prov. 3:11&ndash;12</a>), and that &ldquo;the Father of spirits … disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.9-10">Heb. 12:9&ndash;10</a>). When we disobey, God the Father is grieved, much as an earthly father is grieved with his children&rsquo;s disobedience, and he disciplines us. A similar theme is found in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3">Revelation 3</a>, where the risen Christ speaks from heaven to the church of Laodicea, saying, &ldquo;Those whom I <span style="font-style:italic;">love</span> I <span style="font-style:italic;">reprove</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">chasten;</span> so be zealous and repent&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.19">Rev. 3:19</a>). Here again love and reproof of sin are connected in the same statement. Thus, the New Testament attests to the displeasure of all three members of the Trinity when Christians sin. (See also <a href="https://ref.ly/Is59.1-2">Isa. 59:1&ndash;2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.21">1 John 3:21</a>.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Westminster Confession of Faith wisely says, concerning Christians,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although they never can fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">fatherly displeasure</span> and not have the light of His countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance. (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/WestminsterConfession.Chapter_XI,_5">chap. 11, sec. 5</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12">Hebrews 12</a>, together with many historical examples in Scripture, shows that God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">fatherly displeasure</span> often leads to discipline in our Christian lives: &ldquo;He disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.10">Heb. 12:10</a>). Regarding the need for regular confession and repentance of sin, Jesus reminds us that we are to pray each day, &ldquo;Forgive us our sins, as we also have forgiven those who sin against us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.12">Matt. 6:12</a>, author&rsquo;s translation; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn1.9">1 John 1:9</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we sin as Christians, it is not only our personal relationship with God that is disrupted. Our Christian life and fruitfulness in ministry are also damaged. Jesus warns us, &ldquo;As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.4">John 15:4</a>). When we stray from fellowship with Christ because of sin in our lives, we diminish the degree to which we are abiding in Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament writers frequently speak of the destructive consequences of sin in the lives of believers. In fact, many sections of the epistles are taken up with rebuking and discouraging Christians from sin that they are committing. Paul says that if Christians yield themselves to sin, they increasingly become &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; of sin (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.16">Rom. 6:16</a>), whereas God wants Christians to progress upward on a path of ever-increasing righteousness in life. If our goal is to grow in increasing fullness of life until the day we die and pass into the presence of God in heaven, to sin is to do an about-face and begin to walk downhill away from the goal of likeness to God; it is to go in a direction that &ldquo;leads to death&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.16">Rom. 6:16</a>) and eternal separation from God, the direction from which we were rescued when we became Christians.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 506  </span>Peter says that sinful desires that remain in our hearts &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">wage war</span> against your soul&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.11">1 Peter 2:11</a>)&mdash;the military language correctly translates Peter&rsquo;s expression and conveys the imagery that sinful desires within us are like soldiers in a battle and their target is our spiritual well-being. To give in to such sinful desires, to nurture and cherish them in our hearts, is to give food, shelter, and welcome to the enemy&rsquo;s troops. If we yield to the desires that &ldquo;wage war&rdquo; against our souls, we will inevitably feel some loss of spiritual strength, some diminution of spiritual power, some loss of effectiveness in the work of God&rsquo;s kingdom.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, when we sin as Christians we suffer a loss of heavenly reward. A person who has built on the work of the church not with gold, silver, and precious stones, but with &ldquo;wood, hay, stubble&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.12">1 Cor. 3:12</a>) will have his work &ldquo;burned up&rdquo; on the day of judgment and &ldquo;he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.15">1 Cor. 3:15</a>). Paul realizes that &ldquo;we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>). Paul implies that there are degrees of reward in heaven, and that sin has negative consequences in terms of loss of heavenly reward.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. The Danger of &ldquo;Unconverted Evangelicals&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> While a genuine Christian who sins does not lose his or her justification or adoption before God (see above), there needs to be a clear warning that mere association with an evangelical church and outward conformity to accepted &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; patterns of behavior does not guarantee salvation. Particularly in societies and cultures where it is easy (or even expected) for people to profess to be Christians, there is a real possibility that some will associate with the church who are not genuinely born again. If such people then become more and more disobedient to Christ in their pattern of life, they should not be lulled into complacency by assurances that they still have justification or adoption in God&rsquo;s family. A consistent pattern of disobedience to Christ coupled with a lack of the elements of the fruit of the Holy Spirit such as love, joy, peace, and so forth (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.22-23">Gal. 5:22&ndash;23</a>) is a warning signal that the person is probably not a true Christian inwardly, that there probably has been no genuine heart-faith from the beginning and no regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus warns that he will say to some who have prophesied, cast out demons, and done many mighty works in his name, &ldquo;I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.23">Matt. 7:23</a>). And John tells us that &ldquo;he who says &ldquo;I know him&rsquo; but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.4">1 John 2:4</a>; here John speaks of a persistent pattern of life). A long-term pattern of increasing disobedience to Christ should be taken as evidence to doubt that the person in question is really a Christian at all.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. What Is the Unpardonable Sin?</span> Several passages of Scripture speak about a sin that will not be forgiven. Jesus says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. And whoever says a word against <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 507  </span>the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.31-32">Matt. 12:31&ndash;32</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A similar statement occurs in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk3.29-30">Mark 3:29&ndash;30</a>, where Jesus says that &ldquo;whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk3.29">Mark 3:29</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk12.10">Luke 12:10</a>). Similarly, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6">Hebrews 6</a> says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they then commit apostasy, since they crucify the son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">Heb. 6:4&ndash;6</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.26-27">10:26&ndash;27</a>; also the discussion of the sin &ldquo;that leads to death&rdquo; [NIV] in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.16-17">1 John 5:16&ndash;17</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These passages could be talking about the same or different sins; a decision about this will have to be made from an examination of the passages in context.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Several different views of this sin have been taken.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		1. Some have thought that it was a sin that could only be committed while Christ was on earth. But Jesus&rsquo; statement that &ldquo;every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.31">Matt. 12:31</a>) is so general that it seems unwarranted to say it is only referring to something that could only happen during his lifetime&mdash;the texts in question do not specify such a restriction. Moreover, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">Hebrews 6:4&ndash;6</a> is speaking of apostasy that has occurred a number of years after Jesus returned to heaven.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		2. Some have held that the sin is unbelief that continues until the time of death; therefore, everyone who dies in unbelief (or at least everyone who has heard of Christ and then dies in unbelief) has committed this sin. It is true, of course, that those who persist in unbelief until death will not be forgiven, but the question is whether that fact is what is being discussed in these verses. On close reading of the verses, that explanation does not seem to fit the language of the texts cited, for they do not talk of unbelief in general but specifically of someone who &ldquo;speaks against the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.32">Matt. 12:32</a>), &ldquo;blasphemes against the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk3.29">Mark 3:29</a>) or commits &ldquo;apostasy&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.6">Heb. 6:6</a>). They have in view a specific sin&mdash;willful rejection of the work of the Holy Spirit and speaking evil about it, or willful rejection of the truth of Christ and holding Christ up to &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.6">Heb. 6:6</a>). Moreover, the idea that this sin is unbelief that persists until death does not fit well with the context of a rebuke to the Pharisees for what they were saying in both Matthew and Mark (see discussion of context below).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		3. Some hold that this sin is serious apostasy by genuine believers, and that only those who are truly born again could commit this sin. They base their view on their understanding of the nature of the &ldquo;apostasy&rdquo; that is mentioned in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">Hebrews 6:4&ndash;6</a> (that it is a rejection of Christ and loss of salvation by a true Christian). But that does not seem to be the best understanding of <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4-6">Hebrews 4&ndash;6</a>. Moreover, though this view could perhaps be sustained with respect to <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6">Hebrews 6</a>, it does not explain blasphemy against the Holy Spirit in the gospel passages, in which Jesus is responding to the Pharisees&rsquo; hard-hearted denial of the work of the Holy Spirit through him.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 508  </span>4. A fourth possibility is that this sin consists of unusually malicious, willful rejection and slander against the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work attesting to Christ, and attributing that work to Satan. A closer look at the context of Jesus&rsquo; statement in Matthew and Mark shows that Jesus was speaking in response to the accusation of the Pharisees that &ldquo;it is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.24">Matt. 12:24</a>). The Pharisees had seen Jesus&rsquo; works repeatedly. He had just healed a blind and dumb demoniac so that he could see and speak (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.22">Matt. 12:22</a>). The people were amazed and were following Jesus in large numbers, and the Pharisees themselves had repeatedly seen clear demonstrations of the amazing power of the Holy Spirit working through Jesus to bring life and health to many people. But the Pharisees, in spite of clear demonstrations of the work of the Holy Spirit in front of their eyes, willfully rejected Jesus&rsquo; authority and his teaching and attributed it to the devil. Jesus then told them clearly that &ldquo;no city or house divided against itself will stand; and if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.25-26">Matt. 12:25&ndash;26</a>). So it was irrational and foolish for the Pharisees to attribute Jesus&rsquo; exorcisms to the power of Satan&mdash;it was a classic, willful, malicious lie.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		After explaining, &ldquo;If it is <span style="font-style:italic;">by the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of God</span> that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.28">Matt. 12:28</a>), Jesus declares this warning: &ldquo;He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.30">Matt. 12:30</a>). He warns that there is no neutrality, and certainly those who, like the Pharisees, oppose his message are against him. Then he immediately adds, &ldquo;Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.31">Matt. 12:31</a>). The willful, malicious slander of the work of the Holy Spirit through Jesus, in which the Pharisees attributed it to Satan, would not be forgiven.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The context indicates that Jesus is speaking about a sin that is not simply unbelief or rejection of Christ, but one that includes (1) a clear knowledge of who Christ is and of the power of the Holy Spirit working through him, (2) a willful rejection of the facts about Christ that his opponents knew to be true, and (3) slanderously attributing the work of the Holy Spirit in Christ to the power of Satan. In such a case the hardness of heart would be so great that any ordinary means of bringing a sinner to repentance would already have been rejected. Persuasion of the truth will not work, for these people have already known the truth and have willfully rejected it. Demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit to heal and bring life will not work, for they have seen it and rejected it. In this case it is not that the sin itself is so horrible that it could not be covered by Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work, but rather that the sinner&rsquo;s hardened heart puts him or her beyond the reach of God&rsquo;s ordinary means of bringing forgiveness through repentance and trusting Christ for salvation. The sin is unpardonable because it cuts off the sinner from repentance and saving faith through belief in the truth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Berkhof wisely defines this sin in the following way:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This sin consists in the conscious, malicious, and wilful rejection and slander, against evidence and conviction, of the testimony of the Holy Spirit respecting the grace of God in Christ, attributing it out of hatred and enmity to the Prince of Darkness … in committing that sin man wilfully, maliciously, and intentionally <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 509  </span>attributes what is clearly recognized as the work of God to the influence and operation of Satan.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Berkhof explains that the sin itself consists &ldquo;not in doubting the truth, nor in a sinful denial of it but in a contradiction of it that goes contrary to the conviction of the mind, to the illumination of the conscience, and even to the verdict of the heart.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that the unpardonable sin involves such extreme hardness of heart and lack of repentance indicates that those who fear they have committed it, yet still have sorrow for sin in their heart and desire to seek after God, certainly do not fall in the category of those who are guilty of it. Berkhof says that &ldquo;we may be reasonably sure that those who fear that they have committed it and worry about this, and desire the prayers of others for them, have not committed it.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This understanding of the unpardonable sin also fits well with <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">Hebrews 6:4&ndash;6</a>. There the persons who &ldquo;commit apostasy&rdquo; have had all sorts of knowledge and conviction of the truth: they have &ldquo;been enlightened&rdquo; and have &ldquo;tasted the heavenly gift&rdquo;; they have participated in some ways in the work of the Holy Spirit and &ldquo;have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,&rdquo; yet they then willfully turn away from Christ and &ldquo;hold him up to contempt&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.6">Heb. 6:6</a>). They too have put themselves beyond the reach of God&rsquo;s ordinary means of bringing people to repentance and faith. Knowing and being convinced of the truth, they willfully reject it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.16-17">1 John 5:16&ndash;17</a>, however, seems to fall in another category. That passage does not speak of a sin that can never be forgiven, but rather about a sin that, if persisted in, will lead to death. This sin seems to involve the teaching of serious doctrinal error about Christ. In the context of asking in faith according to God&rsquo;s will (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.14-15">1 John 5:14&ndash;15</a>) John simply tells us that he does not say that we can pray in faith for God simply to forgive that sin unless the person repents&mdash;but he certainly does not prohibit praying that the heretical teachers would turn from their heresy and repent and thereby find forgiveness. Many people who teach serious doctrinal error have still not gone so far as to commit the unpardonable sin and bring on themselves the impossibility of repentance and faith by their own hardness of heart.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">E. The Punishment of Sin</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although God&rsquo;s punishment of sin does serve as a <span style="font-style:italic;">deterrent</span> against further sinning and as a <span style="font-style:italic;">warning</span> to those who observe it, this is not the primary reason why God punishes sin. The primary reason is that <span style="font-style:italic;">God&rsquo;s righteousness demands it</span> so that he might be glorified in the universe that he has created. He is the Lord who practices &ldquo;steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, says the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je9.24">Jer. 9:24</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul speaks of Christ Jesus &ldquo;whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, through faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.25">Rom. 3:25</a>, author&rsquo;s translation). Paul then explains why God put forward Jesus as a &ldquo;propitiation&rdquo; (that is, a sacrifice that bears the wrath <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 510  </span>of God against sin and thereby turns God&rsquo;s wrath into favor): &ldquo;This was <span style="font-style:italic;">to show God&rsquo;s righteousness</span> because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.25">Rom. 3:25</a>). Paul realizes that if Christ had not come to pay the penalty for sins, God could not be shown to be righteous. Because he had passed over sins and not punished them in the past, people could rightly accuse God of unrighteousness, the assumption being that a God who does not punish sins is not a righteous God. Therefore, when God sent Christ to die and pay the penalty for our sins, he showed how he could still be righteous&mdash;he had stored up the punishment due to previous sins (those of Old Testament saints) and then, in perfect righteousness, he gave that penalty to Jesus on the cross. The propitiation of Calvary thereby clearly demonstrated that God is perfectly righteous: &ldquo;it was to prove at the present time <span style="font-style:italic;">that he himself is righteous</span> and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.26">Rom. 3:26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore in the cross we have a clear demonstration of the reason God punishes sin: if he did not punish sin he would not be a righteous God, and there would be no ultimate justice in the universe. But when sin is punished, God is showing himself to be a righteous judge over all, and justice is being done in his universe.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. Has reading this chapter increased your awareness of the sin remaining in your own life? Are you able to mention any specific ways in which this was true? Did the chapter increase in you any sense of the hatefulness of sin? Why do you not feel more often a deeper sense of the hatefulness of sin? What do you think the overall effect of this chapter will be on your personal relationship with God?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. Would it ultimately be more comforting to you to think that sin came into the world because God ordained that it would come through secondary agents, or because he could not prevent it, even though it was against his will? How would you feel about the universe and your place in it if you thought that evil had always existed and there was an ultimate &ldquo;dualism&rdquo; in the universe?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Can you name some parallels between the temptation faced by Eve and temptations that you face even now in your Christian life?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. Do you feel a sense of unfairness that you are counted guilty because of Adam&rsquo;s sin (if you agree that <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.12-21">Rom. 5:12&ndash;21</a> teaches this)? How can you deal with this sense of unfairness to keep it from becoming a hindrance in your relationship with God? At a level of deep conviction, do you really think that, before being a Christian, you were totally unable to do any spiritual good before God? Similarly, are you deeply convinced that this is true of all unbelievers, or do you think that this is just a doctrine that may or may not be true, or at least one that you do not find deeply convincing as you look at the lives of the unbelievers whom you know?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. What kind of freedom of choice do the unbelievers whom you know actually have? Apart from the work of the Holy Spirit, are you convinced that they will not change their fundamental rebellion against God?

What is your response to that sense?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 7. Do you think that Christians today have lost sight of the hatefulness of sin to a large extent? Have unbelievers also lost sight of this? Do you think that we as Christians have lost sight of the thoroughgoing pervasiveness of sin in unbelievers, of the truth that the greatest problem of the human race, and of all societies and civilizations, is not lack of education or lack of communication or lack of material well-being, but sin against God?

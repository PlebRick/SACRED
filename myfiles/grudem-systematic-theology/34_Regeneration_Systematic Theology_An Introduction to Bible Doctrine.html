		<span style="font-weight:bold;">EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define regeneration as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">Regeneration is a secret act of God in which he imparts new spiritual life to us</span>. This is sometimes called &ldquo;being born again&rdquo; (using language from <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.3-8">John 3:3&ndash;8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Regeneration Is Totally a Work of God</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In some of the elements of the application of redemption that we discuss in subsequent chapters, we play an active part (this is true, for example, of conversion, sanctification and perseverance). But in the work of regeneration we play no active role at all. It is instead totally a work of God. We see this, for example, when John talks about those to whom Christ gave power to become children of God&mdash;they &ldquo;were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.13">John 1:13</a>). Here John specifies that children of God are those who are &ldquo;born … of God&rdquo; and our human will (&ldquo;the will of man&rdquo;) does not bring about this kind of birth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that we are passive in regeneration is also evident when Scripture refers to it as being &ldquo;born&rdquo; or being &ldquo;born again&rdquo; (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.18">James 1:18</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.3">1 Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.3-8">John 3:3&ndash;8</a>). We did not choose to be made physically alive and we did not choose to be born&mdash;it is something that happened to us; similarly, these analogies in Scripture suggest that we are entirely passive in regeneration.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This sovereign work of God in regeneration was also predicted in the prophecy of Ezekiel. Through him God promised a time in the future when he would give new spiritual life to his people:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A <span style="font-style:italic;">new heart</span> I will give you, and <span style="font-style:italic;">a new spirit I will put within you;</span> and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eze36.26-27">Ezek. 36:26&ndash;27</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Which member of the Trinity is the one who causes regeneration? When Jesus speaks of being &ldquo;born of the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.8">John 3:8</a>), he indicates that it is especially God the Holy Spirit who produces regeneration. But other verses also indicate the involvement of God the Father in regeneration: Paul specifies that it is God who <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 700  </span>&ldquo;made us alive together with Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.5">Eph. 2:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.13">Col. 2:13</a>). And James says that it is the &ldquo;Father of lights&rdquo; who gave us new birth: &ldquo;Of his own will <span style="font-style:italic;">he brought us forth</span> by the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.17-18">James 1:17&ndash;18</a>). Finally, Peter says that God &ldquo;according to his abundant mercy <span style="font-style:italic;">has given us new birth</span> … through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.3">1 Peter 1:3</a>, author&rsquo;s translation). We can conclude that both God the Father and God the Holy Spirit bring about regeneration.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What is the connection between effective calling and regeneration? As we will see later in this chapter, Scripture indicates that regeneration must come before we can respond to effective calling with saving faith. Therefore we can say that regeneration comes before the <span style="font-style:italic;">result</span> of effective calling (our faith). But it is more difficult to specify the exact relationship in time between regeneration and the human proclamation of the gospel through which God works in effective calling. At least two passages suggest that God regenerates us at the same time as he speaks to us in effective calling: Peter says, &ldquo;You have been <span style="font-style:italic;">born anew</span> not of perishable seed but of imperishable, <span style="font-style:italic;">through the living and abiding word of God.…</span> That word is the good news which was preached to you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.23">1 Peter 1:23</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.25">25</a>). And James says, &ldquo;He chose to <span style="font-style:italic;">give us birth through the word of truth</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.18">James 1:18</a> NIV). As the gospel comes to us, God speaks through it to summon us to himself (effective calling) and to give us new spiritual life (regeneration) so that we are enabled to respond in faith. Effective calling is thus God the Father <span style="font-style:italic;">speaking powerfully to us</span> and regeneration is God the Father and God the Holy Spirit <span style="font-style:italic;">working powerfully in us</span> to make us alive. These two things must have happened simultaneously as Peter was preaching the gospel to the household of Cornelius, for while he was still preaching &ldquo;the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac10.44">Acts 10:44</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Sometimes the term <span style="font-style:italic;">irresistible grace</span> is used in this connection. It refers to the fact that God effectively calls people and also gives them regeneration, and both actions guarantee that we will respond in saving faith. The term <span style="font-style:italic;">irresistible grace</span> is subject to misunderstanding, however, since it <span style="font-style:italic;">seems</span> to imply that people do not make a voluntary, willing choice in responding to the gospel&mdash;a wrong idea, and a wrong understanding of the term <span style="font-style:italic;">irresistible grace</span>. The term does preserve something valuable, however, because it indicates that God&rsquo;s work reaches into our hearts to bring about a response that is absolutely certain&mdash;even though we respond voluntarily.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 701  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">B. The Exact Nature of Regeneration Is Mysterious to Us</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Exactly what happens in regeneration is mysterious to us. We know that somehow we who were spiritually dead (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.1">Eph. 2:1</a>) have been made alive to God and in a very real sense we have been &ldquo;born again&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.3">John 3:3</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.7">7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.5">Eph. 2:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.13">Col. 2:13</a>). But we don&rsquo;t understand how this happens or what exactly God does to us to give us this new spiritual life. Jesus says, &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.8">John 3:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture views regeneration as something that affects us as whole persons. Of course, our &ldquo;spirits are alive&rdquo; to God after regeneration (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.10">Rom. 8:10</a>), but that is simply because we as <span style="font-style:italic;">whole persons</span> are affected by regeneration. It is not just that our spirits were dead before&mdash;<span style="font-style:italic;">we</span> were dead to God in trespasses and sins (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.1">Eph. 2:1</a>). And it is not correct to say that the only thing that happens in regeneration is that our spirits are made alive (as some would teach), for <span style="font-style:italic;">every part of us</span> is affected by regeneration: &ldquo;If any one is in Christ, <span style="font-style:italic;">he is a new creation;</span> the old has passed away, behold, the new has come&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.17">2 Cor. 5:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because regeneration is a work of God within us in which he gives us new life it is right to conclude that it is an <span style="font-style:italic;">instantaneous event</span>. It happens only once. At one moment we are spiritually dead, and then at the next moment we have new spiritual life from God. Nevertheless, we do not always know exactly when this instantaneous change occurs. Especially for children growing up in a Christian home, or for people who attend an evangelical church or Bible study over a period of time and grow gradually in their understanding of the gospel, there may not be a dramatic crisis with a radical change of behavior from &ldquo;hardened sinner&rdquo; to &ldquo;holy saint,&rdquo; but there will be an instantaneous change nonetheless, when God through the Holy Spirit, in an unseen, invisible way, awakens spiritual life within. The change will <span style="font-style:italic;">become evident</span> over time in patterns of behavior and desires that are pleasing to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In other cases (in fact, probably most cases when adults become Christians) regeneration takes place at a clearly recognizable time at which the person realizes that previously he or she was separated from God and spiritually dead, but immediately afterward there was clearly new spiritual life within. The results can usually be seen at once&mdash;a heartfelt trusting in Christ for salvation, an assurance of sins forgiven, a desire to read the Bible and pray (and a sense that these are meaningful spiritual activities), a delight in worship, a desire for Christian fellowship, a sincere desire to be obedient to God&rsquo;s Word in Scripture, and a desire to tell others about Christ. People may say something like this: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what happened, but before that moment I did not trust in Christ for salvation. I was still wondering and questioning in my mind. But after that moment I realized that I did trust in Christ and he was my Savior. Something happened in my heart.&rdquo; Yet even in these cases we are not quite sure exactly what <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 702  </span>has happened in our hearts. It is just as Jesus said with respect to the wind&mdash;we hear its sound and we see the result, but we cannot actually see the wind itself. So it is with the working of the Holy Spirit in our hearts.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. In This Sense of &ldquo;Regeneration,&rdquo; It Comes Before Saving Faith</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Using the verses quoted above, we have defined regeneration to be the act of God awakening spiritual life within us, bringing us from spiritual <span style="font-style:italic;">death</span> to spiritual <span style="font-style:italic;">life</span>. On this definition, it is natural to understand that regeneration comes before saving faith. It is in fact this work of God that gives us the spiritual <span style="font-style:italic;">ability</span> to respond to God in faith. However, when we say that it comes &ldquo;before&rdquo; saving faith, it is important to remember that they usually come so close together that it will ordinarily seem to us that they are happening at the same time. As God addresses the effective call of the gospel to us, he regenerates us and we respond in faith and repentance to this call. So <span style="font-style:italic;">from our perspective</span> it is hard to tell any difference in time, especially because regeneration is a spiritual work that we cannot perceive with our eyes or even understand with our minds.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet there are several passages that tell us that this secret, hidden work of God in our spirits does in fact come before we respond to God in saving faith (though often it may be only seconds before we respond). When talking about regeneration with Nicodemus, Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, <span style="font-style:italic;">he cannot enter the kingdom of God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.5">John 3:5</a>). Now we enter the kingdom of God when we become Christians at conversion. But Jesus says that we have to be born &ldquo;of the Spirit&rdquo; before we can do that. Our inability to come to Christ on our own, without an initial work of God within us, is also emphasized when Jesus says, &ldquo;No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.44">John </a><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 703  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.44">6:44</a>), and &ldquo;No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.65">John 6:65</a>). This inward act of regeneration is described beautifully when Luke says of Lydia, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord opened her heart</span> to give heed to what was said by Paul&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.14">Acts 16:14</a>). First the Lord opened her heart, then she was able to give heed to Paul&rsquo;s preaching and to respond in faith.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		By contrast, Paul tells us, &ldquo;The man without the Spirit (literally, the &ldquo;natural man&rdquo;) does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co2.14">1 Cor. 2:14</a> NIV). He also says of people apart from Christ, &ldquo;no one understands, No one seeks for God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.11">Rom. 3:11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The solution to this spiritual deadness and inability to respond only comes when God gives us new life within. &ldquo;But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even <span style="font-style:italic;">when we were dead through our trespasses</span> made us alive together with Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.4-5">Eph. 2:4&ndash;5</a>). Paul also says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">When you were dead in your sins</span> and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, <span style="font-style:italic;">God made you alive with Christ</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.13">Col. 2:13</a> NIV).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The idea that regeneration comes before saving faith is not always understood by evangelicals today. Sometimes people will even say something like, &ldquo;If you believe in Christ as your Savior, then (after you believe) you will be born again.&rdquo; But Scripture itself never says anything like that. This new birth is viewed by Scripture as something that God does within us in order to enable us to believe.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The reason that evangelicals often think that regeneration comes after saving faith is that they <span style="font-style:italic;">see the results</span> (love for God and his Word, and turning from sin) <span style="font-style:italic;">after</span> people come to faith, and they think that regeneration must therefore have come after saving faith. Yet here we must decide on the basis of what Scripture tells us, because regeneration itself is not something we see or know about directly: &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.8">John 3:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because Christians often tend to focus on the <span style="font-style:italic;">results</span> of regeneration, rather than the hidden spiritual act of God itself, some evangelical statements of faith have contained wording that suggests that regeneration comes after saving faith. So, for example, the statement of faith of the Evangelical Free Church of America (which has been adapted by a number of other evangelical organizations) says,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We believe that the true Church is composed of all such persons who <span style="font-style:italic;">through saving faith</span> in Jesus Christ <span style="font-style:italic;">have been regenerated</span> by the Holy Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ of which He is the Head. (paragraph 8)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 704  </span>Here the word &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; apparently means the <span style="font-style:italic;">outward evidence of regeneration</span> that is seen in a changed life, evidence that certainly does come after saving faith. Thus &ldquo;being born again&rdquo; is thought of not in terms of the initial impartation of new life, but in terms of the <span style="font-style:italic;">total life change that results</span> from that impartation. If the term &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; is understood in this way, then it would be true that regeneration comes after saving faith.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, if we are to use language that closely conforms to the actual wording of Scripture, it would be better to restrict the word &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; to the instantaneous, <span style="font-style:italic;">initial</span> work of God in which he imparts spiritual life to us. Then we can emphasize that we do not see regeneration itself but only the results of it in our lives, and that faith in Christ for salvation is the first result that we see. In fact, we can never know that we have been regenerated until we come to faith in Christ, for that is the outward evidence of this hidden, inward work of God. Once we do come to saving faith in Christ, we know that we have been born again.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		By way of application, we should realize that the explanation of the gospel message in Scripture does not take the form of a command, &ldquo;Be born again and you will be saved,&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;Believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved.&rdquo; This is the consistent pattern in the preaching of the gospel throughout the book of Acts, and also in the descriptions of the gospel given in the Epistles.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. Genuine Regeneration Must Bring Results in Life</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In an earlier section we saw a beautiful example of the first result of regeneration in a person&rsquo;s life, when Paul spoke the gospel message to Lydia and &ldquo;the Lord opened her heart to give heed to what was said by Paul&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.14">Acts 16:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.44">John 6:44</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.65">65</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.3">1 Peter 1:3</a>). Similarly, John says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ <span style="font-style:italic;">is born of God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.1">1 John 5:1</a> NIV). But there are also other results of regeneration, many of which are specified in John&rsquo;s first epistle. For example, John says, &ldquo;No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God&rsquo;s seed remains in him; he <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot go on sinning</span> because he has been born of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.9">1 John 3:9</a> NIV). Here John explains that a person who is born again has that spiritual &ldquo;seed&rdquo; (that life-generating and growing power) within him, and that this keeps the person living a life free of continual sin. This does not of course mean that the person will have a perfect life, but only that the pattern of life will not be one of continuing indulgence in sin. When people are asked to characterize a regenerated person&rsquo;s life, the adjective that comes to mind should not be &ldquo;sinner,&rdquo; but rather something like &ldquo;obedient to Christ&rdquo; or &ldquo;obedient to Scripture.&rdquo; We should notice that John says this is true of everyone who is truly born again: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">No </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 705  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">one</span> who is born of God will continue to sin.&rdquo; Another way of looking at this is to say that &ldquo;every one who does what is right has been born of him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.29">1 John 2:29</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A genuine, Christlike <span style="font-style:italic;">love</span> will be one specific result in life: &ldquo;Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.7">1 John 4:7</a> NIV). Another effect of the new birth is <span style="font-style:italic;">overcoming the world:</span> &ldquo;And his commands are not burdensome, for everyone born of God has overcome the world&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.3-4">1 John 5:3&ndash;4</a> NIV). Here John explains that regeneration gives the ability to overcome the pressures and temptations of the world that would otherwise keep us from obeying God&rsquo;s commandments and following his paths. John says that we will overcome these pressures and therefore it will not be &ldquo;burdensome&rdquo; to obey God&rsquo;s commands but, he implies, it will rather be joyful. He goes on to explain that the process through which we gain victory over the world is continuing in faith: &ldquo;This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.4">1 John 5:4</a> NIV).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, John notes that another result of regeneration is <span style="font-style:italic;">protection from Satan</span> himself: &ldquo;We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the one who was born of God [that is, Jesus] keeps him safe, <span style="font-style:italic;">and the evil one cannot harm him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.18">1 John 5:18</a> NIV). Though there may be attacks from Satan, John reassures his readers that &ldquo;the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.4">1 John 4:4</a> NIV), and this greater power of the Holy Spirit within us keeps us safe from ultimate spiritual harm by the evil one.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We should realize that John emphasizes these as <span style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span> results in the lives of those who are born again. If there is genuine regeneration in a person&rsquo;s life, he or she <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> believe that Jesus is the Christ, and <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> refrain from a life pattern of continual sin, and <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> love his brother, and <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> overcome the temptations of the world, and <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> be kept safe from ultimate harm by the evil one. These passages show that it is impossible for a person to be regenerated and not become truly converted.
	</p>

		Other results of regeneration are listed by Paul where he speaks of the &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">fruit of the Spirit,</span>&rdquo; that is, the result in life that is produced by the power of the Holy Spirit working within every believer: &ldquo;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.22-23">Gal. 5:22&ndash;23</a>). If there is true regeneration then these elements of the fruit of the Spirit will be more and more evident in that person&rsquo;s life. But by contrast, those who are unbelievers, including those who are pretending to be believers but are not, will clearly lack of these character traits in their lives. Jesus told his disciples:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. <span style="font-style:italic;">You will know them by their fruits</span>. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.15-20">Matt. 7:15&ndash;20</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Neither Jesus nor Paul nor John point to activity in the church or miracles as evidence of regeneration. They rather point to character traits in life. In fact, immediately after the verses quoted above Jesus warns that on the day of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 706  </span>judgment many will say to him, &ldquo;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?&rdquo; But he will declare to them, &ldquo;I <span style="font-style:italic;">never knew you;</span> depart from me, you evildoers&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.22-23">Matt. 7:22&ndash;23</a>). Prophecy, exorcism, and many miracles and mighty works in Jesus&rsquo; name (to say nothing of other kinds of intensive church activity in the strength of the flesh over perhaps decades of a person&rsquo;s life) do not provide convincing evidence that a person is truly born again. Apparently all these can be produced in the natural man or woman&rsquo;s own strength, or even with the help of the evil one. But genuine love for God and his people, heartfelt obedience to his commands, and the Christlike character traits that Paul calls the fruit of the Spirit, demonstrated consistently over a period of time in a person&rsquo;s life, simply <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> be produced by Satan or by the natural man or woman working in his or her own strength. These can only come about by the Spirit of God working within and giving us new life.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. Have you been born again? Is there evidence of the new birth in your life? Do you remember a specific time when regeneration occurred in your life? Can you describe how you knew that something had happened?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. If you (or friends who come to you) are not sure whether you have been born again, what would Scripture encourage you to do in order to gain greater assurance (or to be truly born again for the first time)? (Note: further discussion of repentance and saving faith is given in the next chapter.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Have you thought before that regeneration is prior to saving faith? Are you convinced of it now, or is there still some question in your mind?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. What do you think about the fact that your regeneration was totally a work of God, and that you contributed nothing to it? How does it make you feel toward yourself? How does it make you feel toward God? By way of analogy, how do you feel about the fact that when you were born physically you had no choice in the matter?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. Are there areas where the results of regeneration are not very clearly seen in your own life? Do you think it is possible for a person to be regenerated and then stagnate spiritually so that there is little or no growth? What circumstances might a person live in that would lead to such spiritual stagnation and lack of growth (if that is possible), even though the person was truly born again? To what degree does the kind of church one attends, the teaching one receives, the kind of Christian fellowship one has, and the regularity of one&rsquo;s personal time of Bible reading and prayer, affect one&rsquo;s own spiritual life and growth?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 6. If regeneration is entirely a work of God and human beings can do nothing to bring it about, then what good does it do to preach the gospel to people at all? Is it somewhat absurd or even cruel to preach the gospel and ask for a response from people who cannot respond because they are spiritually dead? How do you resolve this question?

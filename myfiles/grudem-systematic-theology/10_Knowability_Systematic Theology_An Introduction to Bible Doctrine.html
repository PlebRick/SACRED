		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. The Necessity for God to Reveal Himself to Us</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If we are to know God at all, it is necessary that he reveal himself to us. Even when discussing the revelation of God that comes through nature, Paul says that what can be known about God is plain to people &ldquo;because <span style="font-style:italic;">God has shown it to them</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.19">Rom. 1:19</a>). The natural creation reveals God because he chose to have himself revealed in this way.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With regard to the personal knowledge of God that comes in salvation, this idea is even more explicit. Jesus says, &ldquo;No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and <span style="font-style:italic;">any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.27">Matt. 11:27</a>). This kind of knowledge of God is not found through human effort or wisdom: &ldquo;in the wisdom of God, <span style="font-style:italic;">the world did not know God through wisdom</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.21">1 Cor. 1:21</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co2.14">1 Cor. 2:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co4.3-4">2 Cor. 4:3&ndash;4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.18">John 1:18</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The necessity for God to reveal himself to us also is seen in the fact that sinful people misinterpret the revelation about God found in nature. Those who &ldquo;by their wickedness suppress the truth&rdquo; are those who &ldquo;became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened … they exchanged the truth about God for a lie&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.18">Rom. 1:18</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.21">21</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.25">25</a>). Therefore, we need Scripture if we are to interpret natural revelation rightly. Hundreds of false religions in the world are evidence of the way sinful people, without guidance from Scripture, will always misunderstand and distort the revelation about God found in nature. But the Bible alone tells us <span style="font-style:italic;">how to understand the testimony about God from nature</span>. Therefore we depend on God&rsquo;s active communication to us in Scripture for our true knowledge of God.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. We Can Never Fully Understand God</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because God is infinite and we are finite or limited, we can never fully understand God. In this sense God is said to be <span style="font-style:italic;">incomprehensible</span> where the term <span style="font-style:italic;">incomprehensible</span> is used with an older and less common sense, &ldquo;unable to be <span style="font-style:italic;">fully</span> understood.&rdquo; This sense must be clearly distinguished from the more common meaning, &ldquo;unable to be understood.&rdquo; It is not true to say that God is unable to be understood, but it is true to say that he cannot be understood fully or exhaustively.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 150  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Ps145">Psalm 145</a> says, &ldquo;Great is the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, and greatly to be praised, and <span style="font-style:italic;">his greatness is unsearchable</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps145.3">Ps. 145:3</a>). God&rsquo;s greatness is beyond searching out or discovering: it is too great ever to be fully known. Regarding God&rsquo;s understanding, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps147">Psalm 147</a> says, &ldquo;Great is our <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, and abundant in power; <span style="font-style:italic;">his understanding is beyond measure</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps147.5">Ps. 147:5</a>). We will never be able to measure or fully know the understanding of God: it is far too great for us to equal or to understand. Similarly, when thinking of God&rsquo;s knowledge of all his ways, David says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;</span> it is high, I cannot attain it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps139.6">Ps. 139:6</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps139.17">17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul implies this incomprehensibility of God when he says that &ldquo;the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God,&rdquo; and then goes on to say that &ldquo;no one comprehends the things of God except the Spirit of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co2.10-12">1 Cor. 2:10&ndash;12</a>). At the end of a long discussion on the history of God&rsquo;s great plan of redemption, Paul breaks forth into praise: &ldquo;O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.33">Rom. 11:33</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These verses allow us to take our understanding of the incomprehensibility of God one step further. It is not only true that we can never fully understand God; it is also true that <span style="font-style:italic;">we can never fully understand </span><span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(218, 224, 194);">any single thing</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> about God</span>. His greatness (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps145.3">Ps. 145:3</a>), his understanding (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps147.5">Ps. 147:5</a>), his knowledge (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps139.6">Ps. 139:6</a>), his riches, wisdom, judgments, and ways (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.33">Rom. 11:33</a>) are <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> beyond our ability to understand fully. Other verses also support this idea: as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are God&rsquo;s ways higher than our ways and his thoughts than our thoughts (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is55.9">Isa. 55:9</a>). Job says that God&rsquo;s great acts in creating and sustaining the earth are &ldquo;but the outskirts of his ways,&rdquo; and exclaims, &ldquo;how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job26.14">Job 26:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Job11.7-9">11:7&ndash;9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Job37.5">37:5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, we may know <span style="font-style:italic;">something</span> about God&rsquo;s love, power, wisdom, and so forth. But we can never know his love completely or <span style="font-style:italic;">exhaustively</span>. We can never know his power exhaustively. We can never know his wisdom exhaustively, and so forth. In order to know any single thing about God exhaustively we would have to know it as he himself knows it. That is, we would have to know it in its relationship to everything else about God and in its relationship to everything else about creation throughout all eternity! We can only exclaim with David, &ldquo;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps139.6">Ps. 139:6</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This doctrine of God&rsquo;s incomprehensibility has much positive application for our own lives. It means that we will never be able to know &ldquo;too much&rdquo; about God, for we will never run out of things to learn about him, and we will thus never tire in delighting in the discovery of more and more of his excellence and of the greatness of his works.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Even in the age to come, when we are freed from the presence of sin, we will never be able fully to understand God or any one thing about him. This is seen from the fact that the passages cited above attribute God&rsquo;s incomprehensibility not <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 151  </span>to our sinfulness but to his infinite greatness. It is because we are finite and God is infinite that we will never be able to understand him fully. For all eternity we will be able to go on increasing in our knowledge of God and delighting ourselves more and more in him, saying with David as we learn more and more of God&rsquo;s own thoughts, &ldquo;How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! If I would count them, they are more than the sand&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps139.17-18">Ps. 139:17&ndash;18</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But if this is so in eternity future, then it certainly must be so in this life. In fact, Paul tells us that if we are to lead a life &ldquo;worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him,&rdquo; it must be one in which we are continually &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">increasing in the knowledge of God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.10">Col. 1:10</a>). We should be growing in our knowledge of God through our entire lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If we ever wished to make ourselves equal to God in knowledge, or if we wished to derive satisfaction from the sin of intellectual pride, the fact that we will never stop growing in knowledge of God would be a discouraging thing for us&mdash;we might become frustrated that God is a subject of study that we will never master! But if we rather delight in the fact that God alone is God, that he is always infinitely greater than we are, that we are his creatures who owe him worship and adoration, then this will be a very encouraging idea. Even though we spend time in Bible study and fellowship with God every day of our lives, there will always be more to learn about God and his relationships to us and the world, and thus there will always be more that we can be thankful for and for which we can give him praise. When we realize this, the prospect of a lifelong habit of regular Bible study, and even the prospect of a lifetime of study of theology (if it is theology that is solidly grounded in God&rsquo;s Word), should be a very exciting prospect to us. To study and to teach God&rsquo;s Word in both formal and informal ways will always be a great privilege and joy.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. Yet We Can Know God Truly</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Even though we cannot know God exhaustively, we can know <span style="font-style:italic;">true</span> things about God. In fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">all that Scripture tells us</span> about God is true. It is true to say that God is love (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.8">1 John 4:8</a>), that God is light (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn1.5">1 John 1:5</a>), that God is spirit (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.24">John 4:24</a>), that God is just or righteous (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.26">Rom. 3:26</a>), and so forth. To say this, does not imply or require that we know everything about God or about his love or his righteousness or any other attribute. When I say that I have three sons, that statement is entirely true, even though I do not know everything about my sons, nor even about myself. So it is in our knowledge of God: we have true knowledge of God from Scripture, even though we do not have exhaustive knowledge. We can know some of God&rsquo;s thoughts&mdash;even many of them&mdash;from Scripture, and when we know them, we, like David, find them to be &ldquo;precious&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps139.17">Ps. 139:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Even more significantly, it is <span style="font-style:italic;">God himself</span> whom we know, not simply facts about <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 152  </span>him or actions he does. We make a distinction between knowing <span style="font-style:italic;">facts</span> and knowing <span style="font-style:italic;">persons</span> in our ordinary use of English. It would be true for me to say that I know many facts about the president of the United States, but it would not be true for me to say that I know <span style="font-style:italic;">him</span>. To say that I know him would imply that I had met him and talked with him, and that I had developed at least to some degree a personal relationship with him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now some people say that we cannot know God himself, but that we can only know facts about him or know what he does. Others have said that we cannot know God as he is in himself, but we can only know him as he relates to us (and there is an implication that these two are somehow different). But Scripture does not speak that way. Several passages speak of our <span style="font-style:italic;">knowing God himself</span>. We read God&rsquo;s words in Jeremiah:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, let not the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and <span style="font-style:italic;">knows me</span> that I am the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, says the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je9.23-24">Jer. 9:23&ndash;24</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here God says that the source of our joy and sense of importance ought to come not from our own abilities or possessions, but from the fact that we know him. Similarly, in praying to his Father, Jesus could say, &ldquo;And this is eternal life, that <span style="font-style:italic;">they know you</span> the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.3">John 17:3</a>). The promise of the new covenant is that all shall know God, &ldquo;from the least of them to the greatest&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb8.11">Heb. 8:11</a>), and John&rsquo;s first epistle tells us that the Son of God has come and given us understanding &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">to know him</span> who is true&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.20">1 John 5:20</a>; see also <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga4.9">Gal. 4:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.10">Phil. 3:10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.3">1 John 2:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.8">4:8</a>). John can say, &ldquo;I write to you, children, because <span style="font-style:italic;">you know the Father</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.13">1 John 2:13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that we do know God himself is further demonstrated by the realization that the richness of the Christian life includes a personal relationship with God. As these passages imply, we have a far greater privilege than mere knowledge of facts about God. We speak to God in prayer, and he speaks to us through his Word. We commune with him in his presence, we sing his praise, and we are aware that he personally dwells among us and within us to bless us (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.23">John 14:23</a>). Indeed, this personal relationship with God the Father, with God the Son, and with God the Holy Spirit may be said to be the greatest of all the blessings of the Christian life.

		Throughout the history of the church Christians have enjoyed rearranging the words of the psalms to fit some poetic meter and then setting these psalms to music for personal or group worship. This is an old metrical arrangement of the words to <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps145">Psalm 145</a>, set to the familiar melody of the hymn, &ldquo;Jesus Shall Reign Where&rsquo;er the Sun.&rdquo; Stanza 2 speaks of God&rsquo;s incomprehensibility (&ldquo;The Lord is great; he praise exceeds; his greatness fully search can none&rdquo;), and many of the other stanzas speak of various attributes of God that we know from Scripture. It should give us joy to sing this song, knowing both that we are singing absolutely true things about God, and that his greatness far exceeds any praise we will ever be able to sing to him.

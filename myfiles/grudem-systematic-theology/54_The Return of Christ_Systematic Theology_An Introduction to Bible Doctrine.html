		As we begin the final unit of this book, we turn to consider events that will happen in the future. The study of future events is often called &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">eschatology,</span>&rdquo; from the Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἔσχατος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2274">G2274</a>) which means &ldquo;last.&rdquo; The study of eschatology, then, is the study of &ldquo;the last things.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Unbelievers can make reasonable predictions about future events based on patterns of past occurrences, but in the nature of human experience it is clear that human beings of themselves cannot <span style="font-style:italic;">know</span> the future. Therefore unbelievers can have no certain knowledge of any future event. But Christians who believe the Bible are in a different situation. Although we cannot know everything about the future, God knows everything about the future and he has in Scripture told us about the major events yet to come in the history of the universe. About these events occurring we can have absolute confidence because God is never wrong and never lies.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Regarding our own personal future as individuals, we have already discussed the teaching of Scripture in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.5.41.0.0.0.0.0">41</a> (on death and the intermediate state) and chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.5.42.0.0.0.0.0">42</a> (on glorification). The study of these future events that will happen to individuals is sometimes called &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">personal eschatology.</span>&rdquo; But the Bible also talks about certain major events that will affect the entire universe. Specifically, it tells us about the second coming of Christ, the millennium, the final judgment, eternal punishment for unbelievers and eternal reward for believers, and life with God in the new heaven and new earth. The study of these events is sometimes called &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">general eschatology.</span>&rdquo; In this chapter we will study the question of the return of Christ, or his &ldquo;second coming.&rdquo; Subsequent chapters will deal with the remaining topics in a study of the last things.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There have been many debates&mdash;often heated ones&mdash;in the history of the church over questions regarding the future. In this chapter we will begin with aspects of Christ&rsquo;s second coming with which all evangelicals agree, and then at the end move to one matter of disagreement: whether Christ could return at any time. Then in the following chapter we will discuss the question of the millennium, a topic that has long been a source of disagreement among Christians.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus often spoke about his return. &ldquo;You also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.44">Matt. 24:44</a>). He said, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I will come again</span> and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.3">John 14:3</a>). Immediately after Jesus had ascended into heaven, two angels said to the disciples, &ldquo;This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, <span style="font-style:italic;">will come</span> in the same way as you saw him go into heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.11">Acts 1:11</a>). Paul taught, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord himself will descend from heaven</span> with a cry of command, with the archangel&rsquo;s call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.16">1 Thess. 4:16</a>). The author of Hebrews wrote that Christ &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">will appear a second time</span> not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.28">Heb. 9:28</a>). James wrote, &ldquo;the coming of the Lord is at hand&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.8">James 5:8</a>). Peter said, &ldquo;The day of the Lord will come like a thief&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.10">2 Peter 3:10</a>). John wrote, &ldquo;when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.2">1 John 3:2</a>). And the book of Revelation has frequent references to Christ&rsquo;s return, ending with Jesus&rsquo; promise, &ldquo;Surely <span style="font-style:italic;">I am coming soon,</span>&rdquo; and John&rsquo;s response, &ldquo;Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.20">Rev. 22:20</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This theme, then, is frequently mentioned throughout the New Testament. It is the dominant hope of the New Testament church. These verses predict a sudden return of Christ that will be dramatic and visible (&ldquo;He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him,&rdquo; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re1.7">Rev. 1:7</a>). The passages are far too explicit to allow the idea (once popular in liberal Protestant circles) that Christ himself will not return, but simply that the spirit of Christ, meaning an acceptance of his teaching and an imitation of his lifestyle of love, would increasingly return to the earth. It is not his teachings or his style of conduct, but &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">the Lord himself</span>&rdquo; who will descend from heaven (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.16">1 Thess. 4:16</a>). It is Jesus himself &ldquo;who was taken up from you into heaven&rdquo; who &ldquo;will come <span style="font-style:italic;">in the same way</span> as you saw him go into heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.11">Acts 1:11</a>). His appearing will not be a mere spiritual coming to dwell within people&rsquo;s hearts, but will be a <span style="font-style:italic;">personal</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">bodily</span> return &ldquo;in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.&rdquo;

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. We Should Eagerly Long for Christ&rsquo;s Return</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		John&rsquo;s response at the end of Revelation should characterize Christians&rsquo; hearts in all ages: &ldquo;Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.20">Rev. 22:20</a>). True Christianity trains us &ldquo;to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world, <span style="font-style:italic;">awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Jesus Christ</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Tt2.12-13">Titus 2:12&ndash;13</a>). Paul says, &ldquo;our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we <span style="font-style:italic;">await a Savior</span> the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.20">Phil. 3:20</a>). The term &ldquo;Maranatha&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co16.22">1 Corinthians 16:22</a> (NASB) similarly means, &ldquo;Our Lord, come!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co16.22">1 Cor. 16:22</a> RSV).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1093  </span>Do Christians in fact eagerly long for Christ&rsquo;s return? The more Christians are caught up in enjoying the good things of this life, and the more they neglect genuine Christian fellowship and their personal relationship with Christ, the less they will long for his return. On the other hand, many Christians who are experiencing suffering or persecution, or who are more elderly and infirm, and those whose daily walk with Christ is vital and deep, will have a more intense longing for his return. To some extent, then, the degree to which we actually long for Christ&rsquo;s return is a measure of the spiritual condition of our own lives at the moment. It also gives some measure of the degree to which we see the world as it really is, as God sees it, in bondage to sin and rebellion against God, and in the power of the evil one (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.19">1 John 5:19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But does this mean that we should not undertake long-term projects? If a scientist who is a Christian eagerly longs for Christ&rsquo;s return, then should he or she begin a ten-year research project? Or should a Christian begin a three-year course in a theological seminary or a Bible college? What if Christ were to return the day before graduation from that institution, before there was any chance to give a significant amount of one&rsquo;s time to actual ministry?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Certainly we should commit ourselves to long-term activities. It is precisely for this reason that Jesus does not allow us to know the actual time of his return (see below): he wants us to be engaged in obedience to him, no matter what our walk of life, up until the very moment of his return. To &ldquo;be ready&rdquo; for Christ&rsquo;s return (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.44">Matt. 24:44</a>) is to be faithfully obeying him in the present, actively engaged in whatever work he has called us to. In the nature of the situation, since we do not know when he will return, on that day there will no doubt be some missionaries just departing for the mission field, who will never reach their destination. There will be some men in their last year of seminary education who will never use their training to pastor a church. There will be some researchers handing in their doctoral dissertations on that day, the fruit of years of research that will never be published and never have an influence on the world. But to all of those people who are Christians, Jesus will say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.21">Matt. 25:21</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. We Do Not Know When Christ Will Return</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Several passages indicate that we do not, and cannot, know the time when Christ will return. &ldquo;The Son of man is coming <span style="font-style:italic;">at an hour you do not expect</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.44">Matt. 24:44</a>). &ldquo;Watch therefore, for <span style="font-style:italic;">you know neither the day nor the hour</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.13">Matt. 25:13</a>). Moreover, Jesus said, &ldquo;But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Take heed, watch; for <span style="font-style:italic;">you do not know</span> when the time will come&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk13.32-33">Mark 13:32&ndash;33</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is simply an evasion of the force of those passages to say that we cannot know the day or the hour, but that we can know the month or the year. The fact remains that Jesus is coming &ldquo;at an hour you do not expect&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.44">Matt. 24:44</a>), and &ldquo;at an unexpected hour&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk12.40">Luke 12:40</a>). (In these verses the word &ldquo;hour&rdquo; [<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ὥρα</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK6052">G6052</a>] is best understood in a more general sense, to refer to the time when something will take <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1094  </span>place, not necessarily a sixty-minute period of time.) The point of these passages is that Jesus is telling us that we <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> know when he is coming back. Since he will come at an unexpected time, we should be ready at all times for him to return.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The practical result of this is that anyone who claims to know specifically when Jesus is coming back is automatically to be considered wrong. The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses have made many predictions of specific dates for Christ&rsquo;s return, and all of them have turned out to be wrong. But others in the history of the church have made such predictions as well, sometimes claiming new insight into biblical prophecies, and sometimes claiming to have received personal revelations from Jesus himself indicating the time of his return. It is unfortunate that many people have been deceived by these claims, because if people are convinced that Christ will return (for example) within a month, they will begin to withdraw from all long-term commitments. They will take their children out of school, sell their houses, quit their jobs, and give up work on any long-term projects whether in the church or elsewhere. They may initially have an increased zeal for evangelism and prayer, but the unreasonable nature of their behavior will offset any evangelistic impact they may have. Moreover, they are simply <span style="font-style:italic;">disobeying</span> the teaching of Scripture that the date of Christ&rsquo;s return cannot be known, which means that even their prayer and fellowship with God will be hindered as well. Anyone who claims to know the date on which Christ will return&mdash;from whatever source&mdash;should be rejected as incorrect.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. All Evangelicals Agree on the Final Results of Christ&rsquo;s Return</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		No matter what their differences on the details, all Christians who take the Bible as their final authority agree that the final and ultimate result of Christ&rsquo;s return will be the judgment of unbelievers and the final reward of believers, and that believers will live with Christ in a new heaven and a new earth for all eternity. God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will reign and will be worshiped in a never-ending kingdom with no more sin or sorrow or suffering. We will discuss these details more fully in the following chapters.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, Christians differ over specific details leading up to and immediately following Christ&rsquo;s return. Specifically, they differ over the nature of the millennium and the relationship of Christ&rsquo;s return to the millennium, the sequence of Christ&rsquo;s return and the great tribulation period that will come to the earth, and the question of the salvation of the Jewish people (and the relationship between Jews who are saved and the church).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Before we examine some of those questions in more detail, it is important to affirm the genuine evangelical standing of those who have differing positions on these questions. Evangelicals who hold to these various positions all agree that Scripture is inerrant, and they have a commitment to believe <span style="font-style:italic;">whatever</span> is taught by Scripture. Their differences concern the interpretation of various passages relating to these events, but their differences on these matters should be seen as matters of secondary importance, not as differences over primary doctrinal matters.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nevertheless, it is worth our time to study these questions in more detail, both because we may gain further insight into the nature of the events that God has planned and promised for us, and because there is still hope that greater unity will come about in the church when we agree to examine these issues again in more detail and to engage in discussion about them.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One of the significant areas of disagreement is over the question of whether Christ could return at any time. On the one hand, there are many passages encouraging us to be ready because Christ will return at an hour we do not expect. On the other hand, there are several passages that speak of certain events that will happen before Christ returns. There have been different ways of resolving the apparent tension between these two sets of passages, with some Christians concluding that Christ could still return at any time, and others concluding that he could not return for at least a generation, since it would take that long to fulfill some of the predicted events that must occur before his return.

		What shall we say to these passages? If there were no passages in the New Testament about signs that would precede Christ&rsquo;s return, we would probably conclude from the passages just quoted that Jesus could come at any moment. In this sense, we can say that Christ&rsquo;s return is <span style="font-style:italic;">imminent</span>. It would seem to blunt the force of the commands to <span style="font-style:italic;">be ready</span> and to <span style="font-style:italic;">watch</span> if there was a reason to think that Christ would not come soon.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Before we look at passages on signs that precede Christ&rsquo;s coming, another problem must be considered at this point. Were Jesus and the New Testament authors wrong in their expectation that he would return soon? Did they not think <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1097  </span>and even teach that the second coming of Christ would be in just a few years? In fact, a very prominent view among liberal New Testament scholars has been that Jesus mistakenly taught that he would return soon.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But none of the texts just quoted require this interpretation. The texts that say to be ready do not say how long we will have to wait, nor do the texts that say that Jesus is coming at a time we do not expect. As for the texts that say Jesus is coming &ldquo;soon,&rdquo; we must realize that biblical prophets often speak in terms of &ldquo;prophetic foreshortening,&rdquo; which sees future events but does not see the intervening time before those events occur.

		George Ladd says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The prophets were little interested in chronology, and the future was always viewed as imminent … the Old Testament prophets blended the near and the distant perspectives so as to form a single canvas. Biblical prophecy is not primarily three-dimensional but two; it has height and breadth but is little concerned about depth, i.e., the chronology of future events … the distant is viewed through the transparency of the immediate. It is true that the early church lived in expectancy of the return of the Lord, and it is the nature of biblical prophecy to make it possible for every generation to live in expectancy of the end.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Peter also reminds us that the Lord has a different perspective on time than we do, so that &ldquo;soon&rdquo; with him may not be what we expect: &ldquo;But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.8-9">2 Peter 3:8&ndash;9</a>).

Conclusions From These Signs That Precede Christ&rsquo;s Return</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The impact of these passages seems so clear that, as was mentioned above, many Christians have felt that Christ simply cannot return at any moment. As we look over the list of signs given above, it would not seem to take much argument to demonstrate that most of these events, or perhaps all of them, have not yet occurred. Or at least that is what appears to be the case on a first reading of these passages.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Possible Solutions</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> How can we reconcile the passages that seem to warn us to be ready because Christ could suddenly return, with passages that indicate that several important and visible events must take place before Christ can return? Several solutions have been proposed.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One solution is to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">Christ could not come at any time</span>. This position is taken by Louis Berkhof, in the sentence quoted above. Just how long it would be before Christ would return depends on each person&rsquo;s estimate of how long it will take some of the signs to be fulfilled, such as the preaching of the gospel to all nations, the coming of the great tribulation, and the ingathering of the full number of the Jews who will be saved.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The difficulty with this view is twofold. First, it really seems to nullify the force of the warnings of Jesus that we should watch, be ready, and that he is returning at an hour we do not expect. What force is there in a warning to be ready for Christ to come at an unexpected time when we know that this coming <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> occur for many years? The sense of urgent expectancy of Christ&rsquo;s return is greatly diminished or denied altogether in this position, and that result seems quite contrary to Jesus&rsquo; intention in giving these warnings.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Second, this position seems to use these signs in a way quite opposite from the way Jesus intended them to be used. The signs are given so that, when we see them, they will <span style="font-style:italic;">intensify our expectation</span> of Christ&rsquo;s return. Jesus said, &ldquo;Now <span style="font-style:italic;">when these things begin to take place, look up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk21.28">Luke 21:28</a>). And the warnings are also given to keep believers from going astray and following false messiahs: &ldquo;Take heed that no one leads you astray. Many will come in my name, saying, &ldquo;I am he!&rsquo; and they will lead many astray … And then if any one says to you, &ldquo;Look, here is the Christ!&rsquo; or &ldquo;Look, there he is!&rsquo; do not believe it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk13.5-6">Mark 13:5&ndash;6</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk13.21">21</a>). So the signs are given to keep Christians from being surprised by these remarkable events, to assure them that God knows them all in advance, and to keep them from following after alleged messiahs who do not come in the dramatic, visible, world-conquering way in which Jesus himself will come. <span style="font-style:italic;">But the signs are never given to make us think, &ldquo;</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> couldn&rsquo;t come for a few years.</span>&rdquo; There is no indication that Jesus gave these signs in order to provide Christians with a reason <span style="font-style:italic;">not to be ready</span> for his return or in order <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1100  </span>to encourage them <span style="font-style:italic;">not to expect</span> that he could come at any time! To use the signs that will precede Christ&rsquo;s return in this way (as Berkhof does, for example), is to use them in a way that Jesus never intended. Therefore it does not seem convincing to say that Christ could not come at any time.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The other major solution to this problem is to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">Christ indeed could come at any time</span> and to reconcile the two sets of passages in various ways. (1) One way to reconcile them is to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">the New Testament talks about two distinct returns of Christ</span> or two second comings of Christ, that is, a <span style="font-style:italic;">secret</span> coming at which Christ takes Christians out of the world (a coming &ldquo;for his saints&rdquo;), and then, after seven years of tribulation have occurred on the earth, a visible, <span style="font-style:italic;">public</span> triumphant coming (a coming &ldquo;with his saints&rdquo;) in which Christ comes to reign over the earth. During the seven-year interval all the signs that have not yet been fulfilled (the great tribulation, the false prophets with signs and wonders, the antichrist, the salvation of Israel, and the signs in the heavens) will be fulfilled, so that there is no tension at all between waiting for a coming that could occur &ldquo;at any moment&rdquo; and realizing that a later coming will be preceded by many signs.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The problem with this solution is that it is hard to derive two separate comings of Christ from the passages that predict his return. However, we will not discuss this matter here, but will treat it in the next chapter, when considering the pretribulational premillennial view of Christ&rsquo;s return. It should also be noted that this solution is historically quite recent, for it was unknown in the history of the church before it was proposed in the last century by John Nelson Darby (1800&ndash;1882). This should alert us to the fact that this solution is not the only possible one to the tension presented by the passages quoted above.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(2) Another solution is to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">all the signs have been fulfilled, and therefore Christ in fact could return at any moment</span>. On this view, one could look for possible fulfillments of these signs in the events of the early church, even in the first century. In some sense, it might be said, the gospel was indeed preached to all nations, false prophets arose and opposed the gospel, there was great tribulation in the persecution the church suffered at the hands of some of the Roman emperors, the man of lawlessness was in fact the emperor Nero, and the full number of the Jewish people who are to be saved has gradually come about through the history of the church, since Paul even gives himself as one example of the beginning of this ingathering of the Jewish people (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.1">Rom. 11:1</a>). We will discuss in more detail in the following section the view that the signs preceding Christ&rsquo;s return <span style="font-style:italic;">might</span> have already been fulfilled, but here we can simply note that many people have not found convincing any view saying that they <span style="font-style:italic;">have</span> happened, <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1101  </span>because these signs seem to them to point to much larger events than those that occurred in the first century.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		(3) There is another possible way of resolving these two sets of passages. It is to say that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">unlikely but possible that the signs have already been fulfilled</span> and therefore we simply cannot know with certainty at any point in history whether all the signs have been fulfilled or not. This position is an attractive one because it takes seriously the primary purpose for the signs, the primary purpose for the warnings, and the fact that we are not to know when Christ will return. With regard to the signs, their primary purpose is to intensify our expectation of Christ&rsquo;s return. Therefore whenever we see indications of things that resemble these signs, our expectation of Christ&rsquo;s return will be aroused and intensified. With regard to the warnings to be ready, advocates of this position would say that Christ <span style="font-style:italic;">could</span> return at any time (since we cannot be certain that the signs have not been fulfilled), and so we must be ready, even though it is <span style="font-style:italic;">unlikely</span> that Christ will return at once (because it seems that there are several signs yet to be fulfilled). Finally, this position agrees that we cannot know when Christ will return, and that he is coming at an hour we do not expect.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But is it possible that these signs have been fulfilled? We can examine them one at a time. In each case our conclusion will be that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">unlikely, but possible, that the sign has been fulfilled already</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. The Preaching of the Gospel to All Nations</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Has the gospel been preached to all nations? Probably not, since there are many language groups and tribes that have still never heard the gospel. It is unlikely, therefore, that this sign has been fulfilled. However, Paul does speak in Colossians about the worldwide spread of the gospel. He speaks of &ldquo;the gospel which has come to you, as indeed <span style="font-style:italic;">in the whole world</span> it is bearing fruit and growing&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.5-6">Col. 1:5&ndash;6</a>). He also speaks of &ldquo;the gospel which you heard, <span style="font-style:italic;">which has been preached to every creature under heaven</span> and of which I, Paul, became a minister&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.23">Col. 1:23</a>). In these verses he certainly does not mean that every creature alive has heard the proclamation of the gospel, but that the proclamation has gone forth to the whole world and that, in a representative sense at least, the gospel has been preached to the whole world or to all nations. Therefore, though, it is unlikely but possible that this sign was initially fulfilled in the first century and has been fulfilled in a greater sense many times since then.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Great Tribulation</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Once again, it seems likely that the language of Scripture indicates a period of suffering coming to the earth that is far greater than anything that has yet been experienced. But it must be realized that many people have <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1102  </span>understood Jesus&rsquo; warnings about great tribulation to refer to the Roman siege of Jerusalem in the Jewish War of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 66&ndash;70. The suffering during that war was indeed terrible, and could be what was described by Jesus in predicting this tribulation. In fact, since the first century, there have been many periods of violent and intense persecution of Christians, and even in our century much of it has occurred over large portions of the globe, with Christians being horribly persecuted in the former Soviet Union, in communist China, and in Muslim countries. It would be difficult to convince some Christians in this century who have undergone decades of persecution for their faith, and have known that persecution to affect thousands of other Christians throughout large segments of the world, that such a great tribulation has certainly not yet occurred. They have longed and prayed for years for Christ to come and rescue them from the tribulation that they are enduring.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Once again, though we may think that Jesus&rsquo; words indicate the likelihood of a yet greater persecution coming in the future, it is difficult to be certain of this. It seems appropriate to conclude that it is unlikely but possible that the prediction of a great tribulation has already been fulfilled.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">False Christs</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> and False Prophets</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> With regard to the false christs and false prophets who will work signs and wonders, any missionary who has worked among people where witchcraft and demonic activity are rampant will readily testify that seemingly miraculous &ldquo;signs and wonders&rdquo; have been worked frequently by demonic power in opposition to the spread of the gospel. Certainly demonic miracles and false signs have been done for centuries, at least since the time that the magicians in Pharaoh&rsquo;s court produced false signs in opposition to Moses&rsquo; miracles (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ex7.11">Ex. 7:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ex8.7">8:7</a>; cf. the activity of Simon the Sorcerer in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.9-11">Acts 8:9&ndash;11</a>). Whatever the specific form it takes, such working of deceptive miracles is almost always accompanied by false religions, leading many people astray (leaders of such groups could be called false messiahs and false prophets). It seems likely that Jesus&rsquo; words predict a far greater manifestation of this kind of activity in the time just prior to his return, but again, it is difficult to be certain that this will be so. It is best to conclude that it is unlikely but still possible that this sign has been fulfilled already.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">d. Powerful Signs in the Heavens</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The occurrence of powerful signs in the heavens is the one sign that almost certainly has not yet occurred. Of course, there have been eclipses of the sun and moon, and comets have appeared, since the world began. But Jesus speaks of something far greater: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The sun will be darkened</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">the moon will not give its light</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">the stars will fall from heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">the powers of the heavens will be shaken</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.29">Matt. 24:29</a>). Although R.T. France attempts to explain this as symbolic language that refers to the destruction of Jerusalem and God&rsquo;s judgment on it, he must base this claim on the assertion that <a href="https://ref.ly/Is13.10">Isaiah 13:10</a> (from which Jesus&rsquo; words in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.29">Matt. 24:29</a> seem to be drawn) is also merely symbolic language to refer to the fall of Babylon, whereas it is more likely that <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1103  </span>both <a href="https://ref.ly/Is13.10">Isaiah 13:10</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.29">Matthew 24:29</a> speak of a yet future literal falling of the stars and blackening of the sun and moon, something that would be a suitable prelude to the shaking of the earth and heaven and the cosmic destruction that will come after the return of Christ (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.10-12">Heb. 1:10&ndash;12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.27">12:27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.10-11">2 Peter 3:10&ndash;11</a>). Moreover, it is significant that this description of cosmic events in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.29">Matthew 24:29</a> is followed in the rest of the sentence with the description of &ldquo;the Son of man <span style="font-style:italic;">coming on the clouds of heaven</span> with power and great glory&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt24.30">30</a>). Given these facts, it seems unlikely that the descriptions of the falling of the stars from heaven and the darkening of the sun and moon are merely symbolic language. It is better to regard them as literal signs that will occur just before Christ&rsquo;s return, and as such, they fall in a different category from the other signs, since it seems certain that they have not yet occurred. Nonetheless, they could occur very quickly&mdash;within the space of a few minutes or at most an hour or two&mdash;to be followed immediately by Christ&rsquo;s return. These particular signs are not the type that would lead us to deny that Christ could return at any time.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">e. The Appearance of the Man of Lawlessness</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Many attempts have been made throughout history to identify the man of lawlessness (the &ldquo;antichrist&rdquo;) with historical figures who had great authority and brought havoc and devastation among people on the earth. The ancient Roman emperors Nero and Domitian, both of whom severely persecuted Christians, were thought by many to be the antichrist. (Many Roman emperors, including these two, claimed deity for themselves and demanded to be worshiped.) In more recent times Adolf Hitler was commonly thought to be the antichrist, as was Joseph Stalin. On the other hand, many Protestants since the Reformation, especially those who were persecuted by the Catholic Church, have thought that one or another of the popes was the antichrist.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But all of these identifications have proved false, and it is likely that a yet worse &ldquo;man of lawlessness&rdquo; will arise on the world scene and bring unparalleled suffering and persecution, only to be destroyed by Jesus when he comes again. But the evil perpetrated by many of these other rulers has been so great that, at least while they were in power, it would have been difficult to be certain that the &ldquo;man of lawlessness&rdquo; mentioned in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Th2">2 Thessalonians 2</a> has not yet appeared. Once again, it is unlikely but possible that this sign has been fulfilled.

The </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Salvation</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> of Israel</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> With regard to the salvation of the fullness of Israel, again it must be said that <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9-11">Romans 9&ndash;11</a> seems to indicate that there will be a yet future massive ingathering of the Jewish people as they turn to accept Jesus as their Messiah. But it is not certain that <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9-11">Romans 9&ndash;11</a> predicts this, and many have argued that no further ingathering of the Jewish people will occur beyond the kind that we have already seen through the history of the church, since Paul gives himself as a primary example of this ingathering (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro11.1-2">Rom. 11:1&ndash;2</a>). Once again, it is unlikely but possible that this sign has already been fulfilled.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">g. Conclusion</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Except for the spectacular signs in the heavens, it is unlikely but possible that these signs have already been fulfilled. Moreover, the only sign that seems certainly not to have occurred, the darkening of the sun and moon and the falling of the stars, could occur within the space of a few minutes, and therefore it seems appropriate to say that Christ could now return at any hour of the day or night. It is therefore unlikely but certainly possible that Christ could return at any time.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But does this position do justice to the warnings that we should be ready and that Christ is coming at a time we do not expect? Is it possible to <span style="font-style:italic;">be ready</span> for something that we think <span style="font-style:italic;">unlikely</span> to happen in the near future? Certainly it is. Everyone who wears a seatbelt when driving, or purchases auto insurance, gets ready for an event he or she thinks to be unlikely. In a similar way it seems possible to take seriously the warnings that Jesus could come when we are not expecting him, and nonetheless to say that the signs preceding his coming will probably yet occur in the future.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This position has positive spiritual benefits as we seek to live the Christian life in the midst of a rapidly changing world. In the ebb and flow of world history, we see from time to time events that <span style="font-style:italic;">could be</span> the final fulfillment of some of these signs. They happen, and then they fade away. During the blackest days of World War II, it seemed very likely that Hitler was the antichrist. During times of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1105  </span>persecution against the church, it can seem more likely that Christians are in the middle of the great tribulation. When we hear of earthquakes and famines and wars, it makes us wonder if the coming of Christ might not be near. Then these events fade into the background and world leaders pass off the scene, and the tide of events leading to the end of the age seems to have receded for a time. Then once again a new wave of events will break on the world scene, and once again our expectation of Christ&rsquo;s return is increased. With each successive &ldquo;wave&rdquo; of events, <span style="font-style:italic;">we do not know</span> which one will be the last. And this is good, because God does not intend us to know. He simply wants us to continue to long for Christ&rsquo;s return and to expect that it could occur at any time. It is spiritually unhealthy for us to say that we know that these signs <span style="font-style:italic;">have not</span> occurred, and it seems to stretch the bounds of credible interpretation to say that we know that these signs have occurred. But it seems to fit exactly in the middle of the New Testament approach toward Christ&rsquo;s return to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">we do not know</span> with certainty if these events have occurred. Responsible exegesis, an expectation of Christ&rsquo;s sudden return, and a measure of humility in our understanding, are all three preserved in this position.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then if Christ does return suddenly, we will not be tempted to object, saying that one or another sign has not yet occurred. We will simply be ready to welcome him when he appears. And if there is great suffering yet to come, and if we begin to see intense opposition to the gospel, a large revival among the Jewish people, remarkable progress in the preaching of the gospel through the world, and even spectacular signs in the heavens, then we will not be dismayed or lose heart, because we will remember Jesus&rsquo; words, &ldquo;When these things begin to take place, look up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk21.28">Luke 21:28</a>).

	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This song vividly pictures the event of Christ&rsquo;s return, with millions of believers coming with him and many more on earth welcoming him as he comes. The &ldquo;clouds&rdquo; with which Christ comes, mentioned in the first line of the hymn, are the clouds of God&rsquo;s glory. The hymn does not hesitate (in v. 3) to portray brilliantly the shaking of the heavens and the earth and the fact that unbelievers will be called to judgment. It ends with a dramatic stanza directly addressing Jesus himself, asking him to come quickly and reign. (Use tune known as &ldquo;Sicilian Mariners.&rdquo;)

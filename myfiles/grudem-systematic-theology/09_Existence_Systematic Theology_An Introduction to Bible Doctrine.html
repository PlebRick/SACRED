	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		How do we know that God exists? The answer can be given in two parts: First, all people have an inner sense of God. Second, we believe the evidence that is found in Scripture and in nature.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. Humanity&rsquo;s Inner Sense of God</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		All persons everywhere have a deep, inner sense that God exists, that they are his creatures, and that he is their Creator. Paul says that even Gentile unbelievers &ldquo;knew God&rdquo; but did not honor him as God or give thanks to him (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.21">Rom. 1:21</a>). He says that wicked unbelievers have &ldquo;exchanged the truth about God for a lie&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.25">Rom. 1:25</a>), implying that they actively or willfully rejected some truth about God&rsquo;s existence and character that they knew. Paul says that &ldquo;what can be known about God is plain to them,&rdquo; and adds that this is &ldquo;because God has shown it to them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.19">Rom. 1:19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet Scripture also recognizes that some people deny this inner sense of God and even deny that God exists. It is &ldquo;the <span style="font-style:italic;">fool</span>&rdquo; who says in his heart, &ldquo;There is no God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps14.1">Ps. 14:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps53.1">53:1</a>). It is the wicked person who first &ldquo;curses and renounces the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>&rdquo; and then in pride repeatedly thinks &ldquo;there is no God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps10.3-4">Ps. 10:3&ndash;4</a>). These passages indicate both that sin leads people to think irrationally and to deny God&rsquo;s existence, and that it is someone who is thinking irrationally or who has been deceived who will say, &ldquo;There is no God.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul also recognizes that sin will cause people to <span style="font-style:italic;">deny</span> their knowledge of God: he speaks of those who &ldquo;by their wickedness <span style="font-style:italic;">suppress the truth</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.18">Rom. 1:18</a>) and says that those who do this are &ldquo;without excuse&rdquo; for this denial of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.20">Rom. 1:20</a>). A series of active verbs indicates that this is a willful suppression of the truth (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.23">Rom. 1:23</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.25">25</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.28">28</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.32">32</a>).

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 142  </span>In the life of a Christian this inner awareness of God becomes stronger and more distinct. We begin to know God as our loving Father in heaven (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.15">Rom. 8:15</a>), the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are children of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.16">Rom. 8:16</a>), and we come to know Jesus Christ living within our hearts (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph3.17">Eph. 3:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.8">Phil. 3:8</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.10">10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.27">Col. 1:27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.23">John 14:23</a>). The intensity of this awareness for a Christian is such that though we have not seen our Lord Jesus Christ, we indeed love him (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.8">1 Peter 1:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Believing the Evidence in Scripture and Nature</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition to people&rsquo;s inner awareness of God that bears clear witness to the fact that God exists, clear evidence of his existence is to be seen in Scripture and in nature.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The evidence that God exists is of course found throughout the Bible. In fact, the Bible everywhere assumes that God exists. The first verse of Genesis does not present evidence for the existence of God but begins immediately to tell us what he has done: &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; If we are convinced that the Bible is true, then we know from the Bible not only that God exists but also very much about his nature and his acts.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The world also gives abundant evidence of God&rsquo;s existence. Paul says that God&rsquo;s eternal nature and deity have been &ldquo;clearly perceived in the things that have been made&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.20">Rom. 1:20</a>). This broad reference to &ldquo;the things that have been made&rdquo; suggests that in some sense every created thing gives evidence of God&rsquo;s character. Nevertheless, it is man himself, created in the image of God, who most abundantly bears witness to the existence of God: whenever we meet another human being, we should (if our minds are thinking correctly) realize that such an incredibly intricate, skillful, communicative living creature could only have been created by an infinite, all-wise Creator.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition to the evidence seen in the existence of living human beings, there is further excellent evidence in nature. The &ldquo;rains and fruitful seasons&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;food and gladness&rdquo; that all people experience and benefit from are also said by Barnabas and Paul to be witnesses to God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.17">Acts 14:17</a>). David tells us of the witness of the heavens: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">The heavens are telling the glory of God;</span> and the firmament proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps19.1-2">Ps. 19:1&ndash;2</a>). To look upward into the sky by day or by night is to see sun, moon, and stars, sky and clouds, all continually declaring by their existence and beauty and greatness that a powerful and wise Creator has made them and sustains them in their order.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This wide variety of testimonies to God&rsquo;s existence from various parts of the created world suggests to us that in one sense <span style="font-style:italic;">everything that exists</span> gives evidence of God&rsquo;s existence. For those who have eyes to see and evaluate the evidence correctly, every leaf on every tree, every blade of grass, every star in the sky, and every other part of creation all cry out continuously, &ldquo;God made me! God made me! God made me!&rdquo; If our hearts and minds were not so blinded by sin, it would be impossible for us to look closely at a leaf from any tree and say, &ldquo;No one <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 143  </span>created this: it just happened.&rdquo; The beauty of a snowflake, the majestic power of a thunderstorm, the skill of a honeybee, the refreshing taste of cold water, the incredible abilities of the human hand&mdash;all these and thousands of other aspects of creation simply could not have come into existence apart from the activity of an all-powerful and all-wise Creator.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, for those who are correctly evaluating the evidence, <span style="font-style:italic;">everything</span> in Scripture and <span style="font-style:italic;">everything</span> in nature proves clearly that God exists and that he is the powerful and wise Creator that Scripture describes him to be. Therefore, when we believe that God exists, we are basing our belief <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> on some blind hope apart from any evidence, but on <span style="font-style:italic;">an overwhelming amount of reliable evidence from God&rsquo;s words and God&rsquo;s works</span>. It is a characteristic of true faith that it is a confidence based on reliable evidence, and faith in the existence of God shares this characteristic.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Furthermore, these evidences can all be seen as valid proofs for the existence of God, even though some people reject them. This does not mean that the evidence is invalid in itself, only that those who reject the evidence are evaluating it wrongly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. Traditional &ldquo;Proofs&rdquo; for the Existence of God</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The traditional &ldquo;proofs&rdquo; for the existence of God that have been constructed by Christian (and some non-Christian) philosophers at various points in history are in fact attempts to analyze the evidence, especially the evidence from nature, in extremely careful and logically precise ways, in order to persuade people that it is not rational to reject the idea of God&rsquo;s existence. If it is true that sin causes people to think <span style="font-style:italic;">irrationally</span> then these proofs are attempts to cause people to think <span style="font-style:italic;">rationally</span> or correctly about the evidence for God&rsquo;s existence, in spite of the irrational tendencies caused by sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Most of the traditional proofs for the existence of God can be classified in four major types of argument:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		1. The <span style="font-style:italic;">cosmological argument</span> considers the fact that every known thing in the universe has a cause. Therefore, it reasons, the universe itself must also have a cause, and the cause of such a great universe can only be God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		2. The <span style="font-style:italic;">teleological argument</span> is really a subcategory of the cosmological argument. It focuses on the evidence of harmony, order, and design in the universe, and argues that its design gives evidence of an intelligent purpose (the Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">τέλος</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5465">G5465</a>, means &ldquo;end&rdquo; or &ldquo;goal&rdquo; or &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;). Since the universe appears to be designed with a purpose, there must be an intelligent and purposeful God who created it to function this way.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		3. The <span style="font-style:italic;">ontological argument</span> begins with the idea of God, who is defined as a being &ldquo;greater than which nothing can be imagined.&rdquo; It then argues that the characteristic of existence must belong to such a being, since it is greater to exist than not to exist.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		4. The <span style="font-style:italic;">moral argument</span> begins from man&rsquo;s sense of right and wrong, and of the need for justice to be done, and argues that there must be a God who is the source of right and wrong and who will someday mete out justice to all people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because all of these arguments are based on facts about the creation that are <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 144  </span>indeed true facts, we may say that all of these proofs (when carefully constructed) are, in an objective sense, valid proofs. They are valid in that they correctly evaluate the evidence and correctly reason to a true conclusion&mdash;in fact, the universe <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> have God as its cause, and it <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> show evidence of purposeful design, and God <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> exist as a being greater than which nothing can be imagined, and God <span style="font-style:italic;">has</span> given us a sense of right and wrong and a sense that his judgment is coming someday. The <span style="font-style:italic;">actual facts</span> referred to in these proofs, therefore, are <span style="font-style:italic;">true</span> and in that sense the proofs are valid, even though not all people are persuaded by them.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But in another sense, if &ldquo;valid&rdquo; means &ldquo;able to compel agreement even from those who begin with false assumptions,&rdquo; then of course none of the proofs is valid because not one of them is able to <span style="font-style:italic;">compel agreement</span> from <span style="font-style:italic;">everyone who considers them</span>. Yet this is because many unbelievers either begin with invalid assumptions or do not reason correctly from the evidence. It is not because the proofs are invalid in themselves.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The value of these proofs, then, lies chiefly in overcoming some of the intellectual objections of unbelievers. They cannot bring unbelievers to saving faith, for that comes about through belief in the testimony of Scripture. But they can help overcome objections from unbelievers, and, for believers, they can provide further intellectual evidence for something they have already been persuaded of from their own inner sense of God and from the testimony of Scripture.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, it must be remembered that in this sinful world <span style="font-style:italic;">God must enable us to be persuaded</span> or we would never believe in him. We read that &ldquo;the god of this world has <span style="font-style:italic;">blinded the minds of the unbelievers</span> to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co4.4">2 Cor. 4:4</a>). Furthermore, Paul says that &ldquo;since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.21">1 Cor. 1:21</a>). In this sinful world, human wisdom is inadequate for coming to know God. Thus, Paul&rsquo;s preaching came &ldquo;in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, <span style="font-style:italic;">that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co2.5">1 Cor. 2:5</a>). We are dependent upon God to remove the blindness and irrationality caused by sin and to enable us to evaluate the evidence rightly, believe what Scripture says, and come to saving faith in Christ.

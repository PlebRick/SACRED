		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. New Testament Evidence</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The Gospels contain abundant testimony to the resurrection of Christ (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.1-20">Matt. 28:1&ndash;20</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk16.1-8">Mark 16:1&ndash;8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.1-53">Luke 24:1&ndash;53</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.1-21.25">John 20:1&ndash;21:25</a>). In addition to these detailed narratives in the four gospels, the book of Acts is a story of the apostles&rsquo; proclamation of the resurrection of Christ and of continued prayer to Christ and trust in him as the one who is alive and reigning in heaven. The Epistles depend entirely on the assumption that Jesus is a living, reigning Savior who is now the exalted head of the church, who is to be trusted, worshiped, and adored, and who will some day return in power and great glory to reign as King over the earth. The book of Revelation repeatedly shows the risen Christ reigning in heaven and predicts his return to conquer his enemies and reign in glory. Thus the entire New Testament bears witness to the resurrection of Christ.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Nature of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was not simply a coming back from the dead, as had been experienced by others before, such as Lazarus (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn11.1-44">John 11:1&ndash;44</a>), for then Jesus would have been subject to weakness and aging and eventually would have died again just as all other human beings die. Rather, when he rose from the dead Jesus was the &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.20">1 Cor. 15:20</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.23">23</a>) <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 609  </span>of a new kind of human life, a life in which his body was made perfect, no longer subject to weakness, aging, or death, but able to live eternally.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is true that two of Jesus&rsquo; disciples did not recognize him when they walked with him on the road to Emmaus (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.13-32">Luke 24:13&ndash;32</a>), but Luke specifically tells us that this was because &ldquo;their eyes were kept from recognizing him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.16">Luke 24:16</a>), and later &ldquo;their eyes were opened and they recognized him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.31">Luke 24:31</a>). Mary Magdalene failed to recognize Jesus only for a moment (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.14-16">John 20:14&ndash;16</a>), but it may have been still quite dark and she was not at first looking at him&mdash;she had come the first time &ldquo;while it was still dark&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.1">John 20:1</a>), and she &ldquo;turned&rdquo; to speak to Jesus once she recognized him (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.16">John 20:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On other occasions the disciples seemed to have recognized Jesus fairly quickly (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.9">Matt. 28:9</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.17">17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.19-20">John 20:19&ndash;20</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.26-28">26&ndash;28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn21.7">21:7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn21.12">12</a>). When Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples in Jerusalem, they were initially startled and frightened (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.33">Luke 24:33</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.37">37</a>), yet when they saw Jesus&rsquo; hands and his feet and watched him eat a piece of fish, they were convinced that he had risen from the dead. These examples indicate that there was a considerable degree of continuity between the physical appearance of Jesus before his death and after his resurrection. Yet Jesus did not look exactly as he had before he died, for in addition to the initial amazement of the disciples at what they apparently thought could not happen, there was probably sufficient difference in his physical appearance for Jesus not to be immediately recognized. Perhaps that difference in appearance was simply the difference between a man who had lived a life of suffering, hardship, and grief, and one whose body was restored to its full youthful appearance of perfect health: though Jesus&rsquo; body was still a physical body, it was raised as a transformed body, never able again to suffer, be weak or ill, or die; it had &ldquo;put on immortality&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.53">1 Cor. 15:53</a>). Paul says the resurrection body is raised &ldquo;imperishable … in glory … in power … a spiritual body&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.42-44">1 Cor. 15:42&ndash;44</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that Jesus had a physical body that could be touched and handled after the resurrection is seen in that the disciples &ldquo;took hold of his feet&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.9">Matt. 28:9</a>), that he appeared to the disciples on the road to Emmaus to be just another traveler on the road (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.15-18">Luke 24:15&ndash;18</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.28-29">28&ndash;29</a>), that he took bread and broke it (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.30">Luke 24:30</a>), that he ate a piece of broiled fish to demonstrate clearly that he had a physical body and was not just a spirit, that Mary thought him to be a gardener (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.15">John 20:15</a>), that &ldquo;he showed them his hands and his side&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.20">John 20:20</a>), that he invited Thomas to touch his hands and his side (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.27">John 20:27</a>), that he prepared breakfast for his disciples (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn21.12-13">John 21:12&ndash;13</a>), and that he explicitly told them, &ldquo;See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see; for <span style="font-style:italic;">a spirit has not </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 610  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">flesh and bones as you see that I have</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.39">Luke 24:39</a>). Peter said that the disciples &ldquo;ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac10.41">Acts 10:41</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is true that Jesus apparently was able to appear and disappear out of sight quite suddenly (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.31">Luke 24:31</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.36">36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.19">John 20:19</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.26">26</a>). Yet we should be careful not to draw too many conclusions from this fact, for not all the passages affirm that Jesus could suddenly appear or disappear; some just say that Jesus came and stood among the disciples. When Jesus suddenly vanished from the sight of the disciples in Emmaus, this may have been a special miraculous occurrence, such as happened when &ldquo;the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.39">Acts 8:39</a>). Nor should we make too much of the fact that Jesus came and stood among the disciples on two occasions when the doors were &ldquo;shut&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.19">John 20:19</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.26">26</a>), for no text says that Jesus &ldquo;passed through walls&rdquo; or anything like that. Indeed, on another occasion in the New Testament where someone needed to pass through a locked door, the door miraculously opened (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.10">Acts 12:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Murray Harris has recently proposed an alternative interpretation to the verses quoted above, especially the verses showing Jesus appearing and disappearing at different times: he says that these verses show that while Jesus could sometimes materialize into a physical body, his customary existence was in a nonphysical or nonfleshly form of his &ldquo;spiritual body.&rdquo; Moreover, when he ascended into heaven after forty days, Jesus permanently gave up any more materializing into a physical body. Professor Harris says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The resurrection of Jesus was not his transformation into an immaterial body but his acquisition of a &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; which could materialize or dematerialize at will. When, on occasion, Jesus chose to appear to various persons in material form, this was just as really the &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; of Jesus as when he was not visible or tangible … After the forty days, when his appearances on earth were ended, Jesus assumed the sole mode of being visible to the inhabitants of heaven but having a nonfleshly body … In his risen state he transcended the normal laws of physical existence. He was no longer bound by material or spatial limitations.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is important to realize that Harris definitely affirms the physical, bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead. He says that the same body that died was also raised, but then it was transformed into a &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; with new properties.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 611  </span>In response, while I do not consider this a doctrinal question of major significance (since it is simply a question about the nature of the resurrection body, about which we now know very little), I nevertheless think the New Testament provides some persuasive evidence that would lead us to differ with Harris&rsquo;s view. Harris agrees that at several times Jesus had a physical body that could eat food and be touched and that had flesh and bones. He even agrees that at Jesus&rsquo; ascension into heaven, &ldquo;It was a real Jesus of &ldquo;flesh and bones&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.39">Luke 24:39</a>) who was taken up before the eyes of his disciples.&rdquo; The only question is whether this body of Jesus at other times existed in nonphysical, nonfleshly form, as Harris claims. To answer that, we have to ask whether the New Testament texts about Jesus appearing and disappearing require this conclusion. It does not seem that they do.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.31">Luke 24:31</a>, which says that after Jesus broke bread and gave it to the two disciples, &ldquo;he <span style="font-style:italic;">disappeared</span> from their sight&rdquo; (NIV), does not require this. The Greek expression used here for &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἄφαντος</span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el"> </span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐγένετο</span>) does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but when found in Diodorus Siculus (a historian who wrote from 60&ndash;30 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span>), it is used once of a man named Amphiaraus who, with his chariot, fell into a chasm and &ldquo;disappeared from sight,&rdquo; and the same expression is used in another place to talk about Atlas who was blown off a mountaintop by high winds and &ldquo;disappeared.&rdquo; In neither case does the expression mean that the person became immaterial or even invisible, but only that he was moved to a place hidden from people&rsquo;s sight. So in <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.31">Luke 24:31</a>, all we can conclude is that the disciples no longer saw Jesus&mdash;perhaps the Spirit of the Lord took him away (as with Philip in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.39">Acts 8:39</a>), or perhaps he was just hidden again from their sight (as with Moses and Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt17.8">Matt. 17:8</a>, or as with the heavenly army around Elisha, <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki6.17">2 Kings 6:17</a>, or [apparently] as with the disciples walking past the prison guards in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.19-23">Acts 5:19&ndash;23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.6">12:6</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.10">10</a>). In neither case do we need to conclude that Jesus&rsquo; physical body became nonphysical, any more than we need to conclude that the disciples&rsquo; bodies became nonphysical when they walked past the guards (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.23">Acts 5:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.10">12:10</a>) and escaped from prison. So <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.31">Luke 24:31</a> does not say that any transformation happened to Jesus&rsquo; body; it merely says that the disciples could no longer see him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 612  </span>As for the claim that Jesus passed through material substances, this is not substantiated in the New Testament. As explained above, the fact that Jesus appeared in a room when the doors had been shut or locked (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.19">John 20:19</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.26">26</a>) may or may not mean that he passed through a door or wall. Especially relevant here is the first deliverance of the apostles from prison: they did not walk through the doors, but &ldquo;an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.19">Acts 5:19</a>); yet the next morning the prison officers reported, &ldquo;We found the prison securely locked and the sentries standing at the doors, but when we opened it we found no one inside&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac5.23">Acts 5:23</a>). The angel had opened the doors, the apostles had passed through, and the angel had closed and locked the doors again. Similarly, when Peter was rescued from prison, he did not dematerialize in order to pass through the locked chains around him, but &ldquo;the chains fell off his hands&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.7">Acts 12:7</a>). In the same way, it is certainly possible that the door miraculously opened for Jesus or even that he had entered the room with the disciples but was temporarily hidden from their eyes.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With regard to the nature of Jesus&rsquo; resurrection body, much more decisive than the texts about Jesus&rsquo; appearing and disappearing are the texts that show that Jesus clearly had a physical body with &ldquo;flesh and bones&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.39">Luke 24:39</a>), which could eat and drink, break bread, prepare breakfast, and be touched. Unlike the texts on Jesus&rsquo; appearing and disappearing, these texts are not capable of an alternative explanation that denies Jesus&rsquo; physical body&mdash;Harris himself agrees that in these texts Jesus had a body of flesh and bones. But what were these physical appearances intended to teach the disciples if not that Jesus&rsquo; resurrection body was definitely a physical body? If Jesus rose from the dead in the same physical body that had died, and if he repeatedly appeared to the disciples in that physical body, eating and drinking with them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac10.41">Acts 10:41</a>) over forty days, and if he ascended into heaven in that same physical body (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.9">Acts 1:9</a>), and if the angel immediately told the disciples that &ldquo;this Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.11">Acts 1:11</a>), then Jesus was clearly teaching them that his resurrection body was <span style="font-style:italic;">a physical body</span>. If the &ldquo;customary form&rdquo; of his resurrection body was nonphysical, then in these repeated physical appearances Jesus would be guilty of misleading the disciples (and all subsequent readers of the New Testament) into thinking that his resurrection body remained physical when it did not. If he was customarily nonphysical and was going to become nonphysical forever at the ascension, then it would be very misleading for Jesus to say, &ldquo;See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 613  </span>me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.39">Luke 24:39</a>). He did not say, &ldquo;… flesh and bones, as you see that I temporarily have&rdquo;! It would have been wrong to teach the disciples that he had a physical body when in his customary mode of existence he really did not.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If Jesus had wanted to teach them that he could materialize and dematerialize at will (as Harris argues), then he could easily have dematerialized before their eyes, so that they could clearly record this event. Or he could easily have passed through a wall while they watched, rather than just suddenly standing among them. In short, if Jesus and the New Testament authors had wanted to teach us that the resurrection body was customarily and essentially nonmaterial, they could have done so, but instead they gave many clear indications that it was customarily physical and material, even though it was a body that was perfected, made forever free from weakness, sickness, and death.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, there is a larger doctrinal consideration. The physical resurrection of Jesus, and his eternal possession of a physical resurrection body, give clear affirmation of the goodness of the material creation that God originally made: &ldquo;And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, <span style="font-style:italic;">it was very good</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.31">Gen. 1:31</a>). We as resurrected men and women will live forever in &ldquo;new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.13">2 Peter 3:13</a>). We will live in a renewed earth that &ldquo;will be set free from its bondage to decay&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.21">Rom. 8:21</a>) and become like a new Garden of Eden. There will be a new Jerusalem, and people &ldquo;shall bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.26">Rev. 21:26</a>), and there will be &ldquo;the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.1-2">Rev. 22:1&ndash;2</a>). In this very material, physical, renewed universe, it seems that we will need to live as human beings with physical bodies, suitable for life in God&rsquo;s renewed physical creation. Specifically, Jesus&rsquo; physical resurrection body affirms the goodness of God&rsquo;s original creation of man not as a mere spirit like the angels, but as a creature with a physical body that was &ldquo;very good.&rdquo; We must not fall into the error of thinking that nonmaterial existence is somehow a better form of existence for creatures: when God made us as the pinnacle of his creation, he gave us physical bodies. In a perfected physical body Jesus rose from the dead, now reigns in heaven, and will return to take us to be with himself forever.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Both the Father and the Son Participated in the Resurrection</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Some texts affirm that God the Father specifically raised Christ from the dead (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.24">Acts 2:24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.4">Rom. 6:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.14">1 Cor. 6:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.1">Gal. 1:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.20">Eph. 1:20</a>), but other texts speak of Jesus as participating in his own resurrection. Jesus says: &ldquo;The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life&mdash;only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.17-18">John 10:17&ndash;18</a> NIV; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn2.19-21">2:19&ndash;21</a>). It is best to conclude that both the Father and the Son were <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 614  </span>involved in the resurrection. Indeed, Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn11.25">John 11:25</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb7.16">Heb. 7:16</a>).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection Insures Our Regeneration</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> Peter says that &ldquo;we have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.3">1 Peter 1:3</a>). Here he explicitly connects Jesus&rsquo; resurrection with our regeneration or new birth. When Jesus rose from the dead he had a new quality of life, a &ldquo;resurrection life&rdquo; in a human body and human spirit that were perfectly suited for fellowship and obedience to God forever. In his resurrection, Jesus earned for us a new life just like his. We do not receive all of that new &ldquo;resurrection life&rdquo; when we become Christians, for our bodies remain as they were, still subject to weakness, aging, and death. But in our spirits we are made alive with new resurrection power. Thus it is through his resurrection that Christ earned for us the new kind of life we receive when we are &ldquo;born again.&rdquo; This is why Paul can say that God &ldquo;made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and <span style="font-style:italic;">raised us up with him</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.5-6">Eph. 2:5&ndash;6</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.1">Col. 3:1</a>). When God raised Christ from the dead he thought of us as somehow being raised &ldquo;with Christ&rdquo; and therefore deserving of the merits of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Paul says his goal in life is &ldquo;that I may know him and the power of his resurrection …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.10">Phil. 3:10</a>). Paul knew that even in this life the resurrection of Christ gave new power for Christian ministry and obedience to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul connects the resurrection of Christ with the spiritual power at work within us when he tells the Ephesians that he is praying that they would know &ldquo;what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe, according to the working of his great might which he accomplished in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.19-20">Eph. 1:19&ndash;20</a>). Here Paul says that the power by which God raised Christ from the dead is the same power at work within us. Paul further sees us as raised in Christ when he says, &ldquo;We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life … So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.4">Rom. 6:4</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.11">11</a>). This new resurrection power in us includes <span style="font-style:italic;">power to gain more and more victory over remaining sin</span> in our lives&mdash;&ldquo;sin will have no dominion over you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.14">Rom. 6:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.17">1 Cor. 15:17</a>)&mdash;even though we will never be perfect in this life. This resurrection power also includes <span style="font-style:italic;">power for ministry in the work of the kingdom</span>. It was after Jesus&rsquo; resurrection that he promised his disciples, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.8">Acts 1:8</a>). This new, intensified power for proclaiming the gospel and working miracles and triumphing over the opposition of the enemy <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 615  </span>was given to the disciples after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead and was part of the new resurrection power that characterized their Christian lives.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection Insures Our Justification</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> In only one passage does Paul explicitly connect Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with our justification (or our receiving a declaration that we are not guilty but righteous before God). Paul says that Jesus &ldquo;was put to death for our trespasses and <span style="font-style:italic;">raised for our justification</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.25">Rom. 4:25</a>). When Christ was raised from the dead, it was God&rsquo;s declaration of approval of Christ&rsquo;s work of redemption. Because Christ &ldquo;humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.8">Phil. 2:8</a>), &ldquo;God has highly exalted him …&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.9">Phil. 2:9</a>). By raising Christ from the dead, God the Father was in effect saying that he approved of Christ&rsquo;s work of suffering and dying for our sins, that his work was completed, and that Christ no longer had any need to remain dead. There was no penalty left to pay for sin, no more wrath of God to bear, no more guilt or liability to punishment&mdash;all had been completely paid for, and no guilt remained. In the resurrection, God was saying to Christ, &ldquo;I approve of what you have done, and you find favor in my sight.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This explains how Paul can say that Christ was &ldquo;raised for our justification&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.25">Rom. 4:25</a>). If God &ldquo;raised us up with him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.6">Eph. 2:6</a>), then, by virtue of our union with Christ, God&rsquo;s declaration of approval of Christ is also his declaration of approval of us. When the Father in essence said to Christ, &ldquo;All the penalty for sins has been paid and I find you not guilty but righteous in my sight,&rdquo; he was thereby making the declaration that would also apply to us once we trusted in Christ for salvation. In this way Christ&rsquo;s resurrection also gave final proof that he had earned our justification.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">c. Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection Insures That We Will Receive Perfect Resurrection Bodies As Well</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The New Testament several times connects Jesus&rsquo; resurrection with our final bodily resurrection. &ldquo;And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.14">1 Cor. 6:14</a>). Similarly, &ldquo;he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co4.14">2 Cor. 4:14</a>). But the most extensive discussion of the connection between Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and our own is found in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.12-58">1 Corinthians 15:12&ndash;58</a>. There Paul says that Christ is the &ldquo;first fruits of those who have fallen asleep&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.20">1 Cor. 15:20</a>). In calling Christ the &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀπαρχή</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK569">G569</a>), Paul uses a metaphor from agriculture to indicate that we will be like Christ. Just as the &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; or the first taste of the ripening crop show what the rest of the harvest will be like for that crop, so Christ as the &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; shows what our resurrection bodies will be like when, in God&rsquo;s final &ldquo;harvest,&rdquo; he raises us from the dead and brings us into his presence.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		After Jesus&rsquo; resurrection, he still had the nail prints in his hands and feet and the mark from the spear in his side (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn20.27">John 20:27</a>). People sometimes wonder if that indicates that the scars of serious injuries that we have received in this life will also remain on our resurrection bodies. The answer is that we probably will not have any scars from injuries or wounds received in this life, but our bodies will be made <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 616  </span>perfect, &ldquo;incorruptible&rdquo; and raised &ldquo;in glory.&rdquo; The scars from Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion are unique because they are an eternal reminder of his sufferings and death for us. The fact that he retains those scars does not necessarily mean that we shall retain ours. Rather, all will be healed, and all will be made perfect and whole.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Ethical Significance of the Resurrection</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Paul also sees that the resurrection has application to our obedience to God in this life. After a long discussion of the resurrection, Paul concludes by encouraging his readers, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Therefore</span> my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.58">1 Cor. 15:58</a>). It is because Christ was raised from the dead, and we too shall be raised from the dead, that we should continue steadfastly in the Lord&rsquo;s work. This is because everything that we do to bring people into the kingdom and build them up will indeed have eternal significance, because we shall all be raised on the day when Christ returns, and we shall live with him forever.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Second, Paul encourages us, when we think about the resurrection, to focus on our future heavenly reward as our goal. He sees the resurrection as a time when all the struggles of this life will be repaid. But if Christ has not been raised and if there is no resurrection, then &ldquo;your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.17-19">1 Cor. 15:17&ndash;19</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.32">32</a>). But because Christ has been raised, and because we have been raised with him, we are to seek for a heavenly reward and set our mind on things of heaven:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If then you have been raised with Christ, <span style="font-style:italic;">seek the things that are above</span> where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.1-4">Col. 3:1&ndash;4</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A third ethical application of the resurrection is the obligation to stop yielding to sin in our lives. When Paul says we are to consider ourselves &ldquo;dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus&rdquo; by virtue of the resurrection of Christ and his resurrection power within us (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.11">Rom. 6:11</a>), he then goes on immediately to say, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Let not sin therefore reign</span> in your mortal bodies … Do not yield your members to sin&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.12-13">Rom. 6:12&ndash;13</a>). The fact that we have this new resurrection power over the domination of sin in our lives is used by Paul as a reason to exhort us not to sin any more.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Ascension Into Heaven</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Christ Ascended to a Place</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> After Jesus&rsquo; resurrection, he was on earth for forty days (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.3">Acts 1:3</a>), then he led them out to Bethany, just outside Jerusalem, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 617  </span>&ldquo;lifting up his hands, he blessed them. While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.50-51">Luke 24:50&ndash;51</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A similar account is given by Luke in the opening section of Acts:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and said, &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac1.9-11">Acts 1:9&ndash;11</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These narratives describe an event that is clearly designed to show the disciples that Jesus went to a place. He did not suddenly disappear from them, never to be seen by them again, but gradually ascended as they were watching, and then a cloud (apparently the cloud of God&rsquo;s glory) took him from their sight. But the angels immediately said that he would come back <span style="font-style:italic;">in the same way</span> in which he had gone into heaven. The fact that Jesus had a resurrection body that was subject to spatial limitations (it could be at only one place at one time) means that Jesus went <span style="font-style:italic;">somewhere</span> when he ascended into heaven.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is surprising that even some evangelical theologians hesitate to affirm that heaven is a place or that Jesus ascended to a definite location somewhere in the space-time universe. Admittedly we cannot now see where Jesus is, but that is not because he passed into some ethereal &ldquo;state of being&rdquo; that has no location at all in the space-time universe, but rather because our eyes are unable to see the unseen spiritual world that exists all around us. There are angels around us, but we simply cannot see them because our eyes do not have that capacity: Elisha was surrounded by an army of angels and chariots of fire protecting him from the Syrians at Dothan, but Elisha&rsquo;s servant was not able to see those angels until God opened his eyes so that he could see things that existed in that spiritual dimension (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki6.17">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Similarly, when Stephen was dying, God gave him a special ability to see the world that is now hidden from our eyes, for he &ldquo;gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.55-56">Acts 7:55&ndash;56</a>). And Jesus himself said, &ldquo;In my Father&rsquo;s house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare <span style="font-style:italic;">a place</span> for you? And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.2-3">John 14:2&ndash;3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Of course we cannot now say exactly where heaven is. Scripture often pictures people as ascending up into heaven (as Jesus did, and Elijah) or coming down from heaven (as the angels in Jacob&rsquo;s dream, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge28.12">Gen. 28:12</a>), so we are justified in thinking of heaven as somewhere &ldquo;above&rdquo; the earth. Admittedly the earth is round and it rotates, so where heaven is we are simply unable to say more precisely&mdash;Scripture does not tell us. But the repeated emphasis on the fact that Jesus went somewhere (as did Elijah, <a href="https://ref.ly/2Ki2.11">2 Kings 2:11</a>), and the fact that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven from God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re21.2">Rev. 21:2</a>), all indicate that there is clearly a localization of heaven in the space-time universe. Those who do not believe in Scripture may scoff at such an idea and wonder how it can be so, just as the first Russian cosmonaut who came back from space and declared that he did not see God or heaven anywhere, but that simply points to the blindness of their eyes <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 618  </span>toward the unseen spiritual world; it does not indicate that heaven does not exist in a certain place. In fact, the ascension of Jesus into heaven is designed to teach us that heaven does exist as a place in the space-time universe. (See chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.7.57.0.0.0.0.0">57</a> for a further discussion of the nature of heaven.)

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Christ Received Glory and Honor That Had Not Been His Before As the God-Man</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> When Jesus ascended into heaven he received glory, honor, and authority that had never been his before as one who was both God and man. Before Jesus died, he prayed, &ldquo;Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.5">John 17:5</a>). In his sermon at Pentecost Peter said that Jesus was &ldquo;exalted at the right hand of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.33">Acts 2:33</a>), and Paul declared that &ldquo;God has highly exalted him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php2.9">Phil. 2:9</a>), and that he was &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti3.16">1 Tim. 3:16</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.4">Heb. 1:4</a>). Christ is now in heaven with the angelic choirs singing praise to him with the words, &ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re5.12">Rev. 5:12</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Christ Was Seated at God&rsquo;s Right Hand (Christ&rsquo;s Session)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> One specific aspect of Christ&rsquo;s ascension into heaven and receiving of honor was the fact that he <span style="font-style:italic;">sat down</span> at the right hand of God. This is sometimes called his <span style="font-style:italic;">session</span> at God&rsquo;s right hand.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Old Testament predicted that the Messiah would sit at the right hand of God: &ldquo;The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> says to my lord: &ldquo;Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps110.1">Ps. 110:1</a>). When Christ ascended back into heaven he received the fulfillment of that promise: &ldquo;When he had made purification for sins, he <span style="font-style:italic;">sat down</span> at the right hand of the Majesty on high&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb1.3">Heb. 1:3</a>). This welcoming into the presence of God and sitting at God&rsquo;s right hand is a dramatic indication of the completion of Christ&rsquo;s work of redemption. Just as a human being will sit down at the completion of a large task to enjoy the satisfaction of having accomplished it, so Jesus sat at the right hand of God, visibly demonstrating that his work of redemption was completed.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition to showing the completion of Christ&rsquo;s work of redemption, the act of sitting at God&rsquo;s right hand is an indication that he received authority over the universe. Paul says that God &ldquo;raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.20-21">Eph. 1:20&ndash;21</a>). Similarly, Peter says that Jesus &ldquo;has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.22">1 Peter 3:22</a>). Paul also alludes to <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps110.1">Psalm 110:1</a> when he says that Christ &ldquo;must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co15.25">1 Cor. 15:25</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One additional aspect of the authority that Christ received from the Father when he sat at his right hand was the authority to pour out the Holy Spirit on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 619  </span>church. Peter says on the Day of Pentecost, &ldquo;Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having <span style="font-style:italic;">received from the Father the promise of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span> he has poured out this which you see and hear&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.33">Acts 2:33</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The fact that Jesus now sits at the right hand of God in heaven does not mean that he is perpetually &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; there or that he is inactive. He is also seen as standing at God&rsquo;s right hand (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.56">Acts 7:56</a>) and as walking among the seven golden lampstands in heaven (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.1">Rev. 2:1</a>). Just as a human king sits on his royal throne at his accession to the kingship, but then engages in many other activities throughout each day, so Christ sat at the right hand of God as a dramatic evidence of the completion of his redemptive work and his reception of authority over the universe, but he is certainly engaged in other activities in heaven as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Christ&rsquo;s Ascension Has Doctrinal Significance for Our Lives</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Just as the resurrection has profound implications for our lives, so Christ&rsquo;s ascension has significant implications for us. First, since we are united with Christ in every aspect of his work of redemption, Christ&rsquo;s going up into heaven foreshadows our future ascension into heaven with him. &ldquo;We who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Th4.17">1 Thess. 4:17</a>). The author of Hebrews wants us to run the race of life with the knowledge that we are following in Jesus&rsquo; steps and will eventually arrive at the blessings of life in heaven that he is now enjoying: &ldquo;Let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.1-2">Heb. 12:1&ndash;2</a>). And Jesus himself says that he will one day take us to be with himself (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.3">John 14:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Second, Jesus&rsquo; ascension gives us assurance that our final home will be in heaven with him. &ldquo;In my Father&rsquo;s house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.2-3">John 14:2&ndash;3</a>). Jesus was a man like us in every way yet without sin, and he has gone before us so that eventually we might follow him there and live with him forever. The fact that Jesus has already ascended into heaven and achieved the goal set before him gives great assurance to us that we will eventually go there also.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Third, because of our union with Christ in his ascension, we are able to share now (in part) in Christ&rsquo;s authority over the universe, and we will later share in it more fully. This is what Paul points to when he says that God &ldquo;raised us up with him, and made us <span style="font-style:italic;">sit with him in the heavenly places</span> in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.6">Eph. 2:6</a>). We are not physically present in heaven, of course, for we remain here on earth at the present time. But if Christ&rsquo;s session at God&rsquo;s right hand refers to his reception of authority, then the fact that God has made us sit with Christ means that we share in some measure in the authority that Christ has, authority to contend against &ldquo;the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.12">Eph. 6:12</a>; cf. vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.10-18">10&ndash;18</a>) and to do battle with weapons that &ldquo;have divine power to destroy strongholds&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co10.4">2 Cor. 10:4</a>). This sharing in Christ&rsquo;s authority over the universe will be made more fully our possession in the age to come: &ldquo;Do you not know that we are to <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 620  </span>judge angels?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.3">1 Cor. 6:3</a>). Moreover, we will share with Christ in his authority over the creation that God has made (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.5-8">Heb. 2:5&ndash;8</a>). Jesus promises, &ldquo;He who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, I will give him power over the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received power from my Father&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.26-27">Rev. 2:26&ndash;27</a>). He also promises, &ldquo;He who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.21">Rev. 3:21</a>). These are amazing promises of our future sharing in Christ&rsquo;s sitting at the right hand of God, promises that we will not fully understand until the age to come.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. States of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In talking about the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, theologians have sometimes talked about the &ldquo;states of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; By this they mean the different relationships Jesus had to God&rsquo;s law for mankind, to the possession of authority, and to receiving honor for himself. Generally two states (humiliation and exaltation) are distinguished. Thus, the doctrine of &ldquo;the twofold state of Christ&rdquo; is the teaching that Christ experienced first the state of humiliation, then the state of exaltation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Within the humiliation of Christ are included his incarnation, suffering, death, and burial. Sometimes a fifth aspect (descent into hell) is included, but as explained above, the position taken in this book is that that concept is not supported in Scripture.
	</p>

		In the exaltation of Christ, there are also four aspects: his resurrection, ascension into heaven, session at the right hand of God, and return in glory and power. Many systematic theologies use the state of humiliation and the state of exaltation as broad categories to organize their discussion of Jesus&rsquo; work.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. As you read this chapter, what aspects of the Bible&rsquo;s teaching about a resurrection body were new to your understanding? Can you think of some characteristics of the resurrection body that you especially look forward to? How does the thought of having such a body make you feel?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. What things would you like to do now but find yourself unable to do because of the weakness or limitations of your own physical body? Do you think these activities would be appropriate to your life in heaven? Will you be able to do them then?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. When you were born again, you received new spiritual life within. If you think of this new spiritual life as part of the resurrection power of Christ working within you, how does that give you encouragement in living the Christian life and in ministering to people&rsquo;s needs?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 621  </span> 4. The Bible says that you are now seated with Christ in the heavenly places (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.6">Eph. 2:6</a>). As you meditate on this fact, how will it affect your prayer life and your engaging in spiritual warfare against demonic forces?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. When you think of Christ now in heaven, does it cause you to focus more attention on things that will have eternal significance? Does it increase your assurance that you will someday be with him in heaven? How do you feel about the prospect of reigning with Christ over the nations and over angels as well?

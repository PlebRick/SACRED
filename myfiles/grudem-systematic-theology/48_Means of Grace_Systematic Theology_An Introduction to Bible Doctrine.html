	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		All of the blessings we experience in this life are ultimately undeserved&mdash;they are all of <span style="font-style:italic;">grace</span>. In fact, for Peter, the entire Christian life is lived by grace (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.12">1 Peter 5:12</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But are there any special <span style="font-style:italic;">means</span> that God uses to give additional grace to us? Specifically, <span style="font-style:italic;">within the fellowship of the church</span> are there certain means&mdash;that is, certain activities, ceremonies, or functions&mdash;that God uses to give more grace to us? Another way of formulating that question is to ask whether there are certain <span style="font-style:italic;">means</span> through which the Holy Spirit works to convey blessings into the life of the believer. Of course, personal prayer, worship, and Bible study, and personal faith, are all means through which God works to bring grace to us as individual Christians. But in this chapter we are dealing with the doctrine of the church, and we are asking specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">within the fellowship of the church</span> what the means of grace are that God uses to bring blessing to us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define the means of grace as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">means of grace</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> are any activities within the fellowship of the church that God uses to give more grace to Christians</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the history of the discussion of &ldquo;means of grace within the church,&rdquo; some theologians have restricted them to three: the preaching of the Word, and the two sacraments (baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 951  </span>But is it wise to make such a short list of &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo;? If we wish to list and discuss all the means of receiving the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s blessing that come to believers specifically through the fellowship of the church, then it does not seem wise to limit the &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; to three activities whose administration is restricted to the ordained clergy or officers of the church. There is wisdom, for example, in Charles Hodge&rsquo;s view that prayer is a fourth means of grace.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But should we limit our discussion of the means of grace to these four activities only? It would seem more helpful to list all of the <span style="font-style:italic;">many varied activities</span> within the church that God has given as special ways of receiving his &ldquo;grace&rdquo; day by day and week by week. Such a list may become quite long, and, depending on how it is organized, may include various numbers of elements. The following list may not be exhaustive, but it does include most of the means of grace that believers have access to within the fellowship of the church:

		All these are available to believers <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the church. The Holy Spirit works through all of them to bring various kinds of blessing to individuals. Therefore, departing from the much shorter lists usually given in systematic theologies, I have decided to call all of these &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; within the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Roman Catholic Church has traditionally believed that God&rsquo;s &ldquo;grace&rdquo; comes to people only through the official ministry of the church, particularly through the priests of the church. Therefore, when it specifies the means of grace (what it calls the &ldquo;sacraments&rdquo;) that are available to people within the church, it has in view activities that are supervised and/or performed by only the priests of the church. The seven &ldquo;sacraments&rdquo; in Roman Catholic teaching are the following:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 1. Baptism
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 2. Confirmation
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. Eucharist (the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as experienced in the mass)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. Penance
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 5. Extreme unction (popularly known as the &ldquo;last rites,&rdquo; the anointing with oil that is administered to a dying person)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 6. Holy orders (ordination to the priesthood or diaconate)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 7. Matrimony
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There is not only a difference in the lists given by Catholics and Protestants; there is also a difference in fundamental meaning. Catholics view these as &ldquo;means of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 952  </span>salvation&rdquo; that make people more fit to receive justification from God. But on a Protestant view, the means of grace are simply means of additional blessing within the Christian life, and do not add to our fitness to receive justification from God. Catholics teach that the means of grace impart grace whether or not there is subjective faith on the part of the minister or the recipient, while Protestants hold that God only imparts grace when there is faith on the part of the persons administering or receiving these means. And while the Roman Catholic Church firmly restricts the administration of the sacraments to the clergy, our list of means of grace includes many activities that are carried out by all believers.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Discussion of Specific Means</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Teaching of the Word</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Even before people become Christians, the Word of God as preached and taught brings God&rsquo;s grace to them in that it is the instrument God uses to impart spiritual life to them and bring them to salvation. Paul says that the gospel is the &ldquo;power of God for salvation&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.16">Rom. 1:16</a>) and that the preaching of Christ is &ldquo;the power of God and the wisdom of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.24">1 Cor. 1:24</a>). God caused us to be born again or &ldquo;brought … forth by the word of truth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas1.18">James 1:18</a>) and Peter says, &ldquo;You have been born anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.23">1 Peter 1:23</a>). It is the written Word of God, the Bible, that is &ldquo;able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti3.15">2 Tim. 3:15</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, once we have become Christians, Paul reminds us that it is the Word of God that is &ldquo;able to build you up&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.32">Acts 20:32</a>). It is necessary for spiritual nourishment and for maintaining spiritual life, because we do not live on bread alone but on &ldquo;every word that proceeds from the mouth of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt4.4">Matt. 4:4</a>). Moses speaks of the absolute necessity of the written Word of God when he tells the people, &ldquo;It is no trifle for you, but it is your life, and thereby you shall live long in the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Dt32.47">Deut. 32:47</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is the Word of God that convicts us of sin and turns us to righteousness, for it is profitable &ldquo;for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti3.16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>). It gives direction and guidance as a &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; to our feet and a &ldquo;light&rdquo; to our path (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps119.105">Ps. 119:105</a>). In the midst of an ungodly culture Scripture gives wisdom and guidance like &ldquo;a lamp shining in a dark place&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.19">2 Peter 1:19</a>). Moreover, it is active in giving wisdom to all, even &ldquo;making wise the simple&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps19.7">Ps. 19:7</a>). It gives hope to those who are in despair, because Paul says that it was written &ldquo;that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro15.4">Rom. 15:4</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The Word of God is not weak or powerless in accomplishing these goals, for it speaks to us with the power of God and accomplishes God&rsquo;s purposes. The Lord says,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,

	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">

		and prosper in the thing for which I sent it. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is55.10-11">Isa. 55:10&ndash;11</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		God&rsquo;s Word is not weak but has his divine power accompanying it: &ldquo;Is not my word <span style="font-style:italic;">like fire</span> says the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">like a hammer</span> which breaks the rock in pieces?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Je23.29">Jer. 23:29</a>). It is so sharp and powerful that it is the &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">sword</span> of the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.17">Eph. 6:17</a>), and it is so effective in speaking to people&rsquo;s needs that the author of Hebrews says, &ldquo;the word of God is living and active, sharper than any <span style="font-style:italic;">two-edged sword</span> piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.12">Heb. 4:12</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So closely are the growth and strength of the church linked to the reign of the Word of God in people&rsquo;s lives that more than once the book of Acts can describe the growth of the church as the growth of the Word of God: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">And the word of God increased;</span> and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.7">Acts 6:7</a>); &ldquo;But <span style="font-style:italic;">the word of God grew and multiplied</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.24">Acts 12:24</a>); &ldquo;And <span style="font-style:italic;">the word of the Lord spread</span> throughout all the region&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.49">Acts 13:49</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So important is the Bible as the primary means of grace that God gives to his people that Charles Hodge reminds us that throughout history true Christianity has flourished &ldquo;just in proportion to the degree in which the Bible is known, and its truths are diffused among the people.&rdquo; Moreover, he notes that there are no evidences of salvation or sanctification to be found where the Word of God is not known. &ldquo;The nations where the Bible is unknown sit in darkness.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is appropriate that we list the teaching of the Word as the first and most important means of grace within the church. But we should add that such teaching includes not only officially recognized teaching by ordained clergy in the church, but also all the teaching that occurs in Bible studies, Sunday School classes, the reading of Christian books on Scripture, and even in personal Bible study.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Baptism</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Since Jesus commanded his church to baptize (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt28.19">Matt. 28:19</a>), we would expect that there would be a measure of blessing connected with baptism, because all obedience to God by Christians brings God&rsquo;s favor with it. This obedience is specifically a public act of confessing Jesus as Savior, an act which in itself brings joy and blessing to a believer. Moreover, it is a sign of the believer&rsquo;s death and resurrection with Christ (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.2-5">Rom. 6:2&ndash;5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.12">Col. 2:12</a>), and it seems fitting that the Holy Spirit would work through such a sign to increase our faith, to increase our experiential realization of death to the power and love of sin in our lives, and to increase our experience of the power of new resurrection life in Christ that we have as believers. Since baptism is a physical symbol of the death and resurrection of Christ and our participation in them, it should also give additional assurance of union with Christ to all believers who are present. Finally, since water baptism is an outward symbol of inward spiritual baptism by the Holy Spirit, we <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 954  </span>may expect that the Holy Spirit will ordinarily work alongside the baptism, giving to believers an increasing realization of the benefits of the spiritual baptism to which it points.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When baptism very closely accompanies someone&rsquo;s initial profession of faith and is in fact the outward form that profession of faith takes, there is certainly a connection between baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, for Peter says to his hearers at Pentecost, &ldquo;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.38">Acts 2:38</a>). Moreover, Paul says, &ldquo;You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col2.12">Col. 2:12</a>). The statement that it is &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">through faith</span> in the working of God&rdquo; that this happens reminds us that there is no magical property in the act of baptism itself, which causes a spiritual result to come about, yet the verse also indicates that when faith accompanies baptism there is genuine spiritual work in the life of the person being baptized. As we would expect, sometimes great spiritual joy follows upon baptism&mdash;a great joy in the Lord and in the salvation that baptism so vividly pictures (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.39">Acts 8:39</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac16.34">16:34</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although we must avoid the Roman Catholic teaching that grace is imparted even <span style="font-style:italic;">apart from</span> the faith of the person being baptized, we must not react so strongly to this error that we say that there is no spiritual benefit at all that comes from baptism, that the Holy Spirit <span style="font-style:italic;">does not</span> work through it and that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">merely symbolic</span>. It is better to say that where there is genuine faith on the part of the person being baptized, and where the faith of the church that watches the baptism is stirred up and encouraged by this ceremony, then the Holy Spirit certainly does work through baptism, and it becomes a &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; through which the Holy Spirit brings blessing to the person being baptized and to the church as well. (Baptism will be more fully discussed in the next chapter.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. The Lord&rsquo;s Supper</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In addition to baptism, the other ordinance or ceremony that Jesus commanded the church to carry out is participation in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. Although this subject will be discussed more thoroughly in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.50.0.0.0.0.0">50</a>, it is appropriate to note here that participation in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is also very clearly a means of grace which the Holy Spirit uses to bring blessing to the church. The Lord&rsquo;s Supper is not simply an ordinary meal among human beings&mdash;it is a fellowship with Christ, in his presence and at his table.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Once again, we must avoid the idea that any automatic or magical benefit comes from sharing in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, whether a person participates in faith or not. But when a person participates in faith, renewing and strengthening his or her own trust in Christ for salvation, and believing that the Holy Spirit will bring spiritual blessing through such participation, then certainly additional blessing may be expected. We must be careful here, as with baptism, to avoid the mistake of overreacting to Roman Catholic teaching and maintaining that the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is <span style="font-style:italic;">merely symbolic</span> and not a means of grace. Paul says, &ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a <span style="font-style:italic;">participation</span> (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">κοινωνία</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3126">G3126</a>, &ldquo;sharing,&rdquo; &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo;) in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 955  </span>the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a <span style="font-style:italic;">participation</span> [<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">κοινωνία</span>] in the body of Christ?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.16">1 Cor. 10:16</a>). Because there is such a sharing in the body and blood of Christ (apparently meaning a sharing in the benefits of Christ&rsquo;s body and blood given for us), the unity of believers is beautifully exhibited at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper: &ldquo;Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.17">1 Cor. 10:17</a>). And since we are participants at &ldquo;the table of the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.21">1 Cor. 10:21</a>), Paul warns the Corinthians that they cannot participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table and also participate in idol worship: &ldquo;You cannot partake in the table of the Lord and the table of demons&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co10.21">1 Cor. 10:21</a>). There is a spiritual union among believers and with the Lord that is strengthened and solidified at the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and it is not to be taken lightly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is why the Corinthians were experiencing judgment for their abuse of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co11.29-30">1 Cor. 11:29&ndash;30</a>: &ldquo;For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died&rdquo;). But if Paul says there will be judgment for <span style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span> participation in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, then certainly we should expect <span style="font-style:italic;">blessing</span> for right participation in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. When we obey Jesus&rsquo; command, &ldquo;Take, eat&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.26">Matt. 26:26</a>), and go through the physical activity of eating and drinking at the Lord&rsquo;s table, our physical action <span style="font-style:italic;">pictures</span> a corresponding spiritual nourishment, a nourishment of our souls that will occur when we participate in obedience and faith. Jesus says, &ldquo;For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.55-56">John 6:55&ndash;56</a>; cf. vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.52-54">52&ndash;54</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.57-58">57&ndash;58</a>; also vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.27">27</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.33-35">33&ndash;35</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.48-51">48&ndash;51</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As with baptism, therefore, we should expect that the Lord would give spiritual blessing as we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper in faith and in obedience to the directions laid down in Scripture, and in this way it is a &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; which the Holy Spirit uses to convey blessing to us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Prayer</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> We have already studied prayer in chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.2.18.0.0.0.0.0">18</a>, so we need only note here that corporate prayer within the church as it assembles, and prayer by church members for one another, are powerful means which the Holy Spirit uses daily to bring blessing to Christians within the church. Certainly we are to <span style="font-style:italic;">pray together</span> as well as individually, following the example of the early church. When they heard the threats of the Jewish leaders, &ldquo;they lifted their voices <span style="font-style:italic;">together</span> to God&rdquo; in prayer (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.24-30">Acts 4:24&ndash;30</a>), &ldquo;And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.31">Acts 4:31</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.42">2:42</a>). When Peter was put in prison, &ldquo;earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac12.5">Acts 12:5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If prayer from the church is not simply the mouthing of words without heartfelt intention, but is the genuine expression of our hearts and the reflection of sincere faith, then we should expect that the Holy Spirit will bring a great blessing through it. Certainly when prayer is done &ldquo;in the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph6.18">Eph. 6:18</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud20">Jude 20</a>: &ldquo;pray in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;), it involves fellowship with the Holy Spirit and therefore a ministry of the Holy Spirit to the people praying. And the author of Hebrews reminds us that as we &ldquo;draw near&rdquo; to God in prayer before the throne of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 956  </span>grace, we do so &ldquo;that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.16">Heb. 4:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The more the genuine fellowship of a church increases, the more there ought to be continual prayer for one another within the church, and the more genuine spiritual blessing from the Holy Spirit may be expected to flow through the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Worship</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Genuine worship is worship &ldquo;in spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn4.23-24">John 4:23&ndash;24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.3">Phil. 3:3</a>), which probably means worship that is in the spiritual realm of activity (not merely the outward physical action of attendance at a worship service or singing of songs). When we enter that spiritual realm of activity and minister to the Lord in worship, God also ministers to us. So, for example, in the church at Antioch, it was &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">While they were worshiping the Lord</span> and fasting&rdquo; that &ldquo;the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.2">Acts 13:2</a>). This parallels the experience of the people of Israel in the Old Testament who knew the presence of God when they engaged in genuine worship:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">When the song was raised</span> with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, <span style="font-style:italic;">in praise to the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> &ldquo;For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever,&rdquo; the house, the house of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> was filled with a cloud, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for <span style="font-style:italic;">the glory of the </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> filled the house of God</span>. (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ch5.13-14">2 Chron. 5:13&ndash;14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When God&rsquo;s people worshiped, he came in a very visible way to dwell in their midst. Similarly in the New Testament, James promises, &ldquo;Draw near to God and <span style="font-style:italic;">he will draw near to you</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas4.8">James 4:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, as God&rsquo;s people worshiped, he delivered them from their enemies (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ch20.18-23">2 Chron. 20:18&ndash;23</a>), or at other times gave them true spiritual insight into the nature of events around them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps73.17">Ps. 73:17</a>: &ldquo;Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If worship is genuinely an experience of drawing near to God, coming into his presence, and giving him the praise he deserves, then we certainly ought to count it one of the primary &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; available to the church. Through genuine congregational worship God will very often bring great blessing, both individually and corporately, to his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Church Discipline</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Because church discipline is a means by which the purity of the church is advanced and holiness of life is encouraged, we certainly should count it as a &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; as well. However, blessing is not automatically given: when the church disciplines, no spiritual good comes to the wrongdoer unless the Holy Spirit convicts him or her of sin and brings about a &ldquo;godly grief&rdquo; that &ldquo;produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co7.10">2 Cor. 7:10</a>), and no spiritual good comes to the church unless the Holy Spirit is active in the other members&rsquo; lives when they become aware of the process. This is why the church is to carry out discipline with the knowledge that it is done in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 957  </span>presence of the Lord (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co5.4">1 Cor. 5:4</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.19-20">4:19&ndash;20</a>), and with the assurance that it has heavenly sanction connected with it (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt16.19">Matt. 16:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt18.18-20">18:18&ndash;20</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It would be very healthy for the church to begin to think of church discipline not as an onerous burden placed upon it by the Lord, but as a genuine &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; by which great blessing can come to the church&mdash;in reconciling believers to one another and to God, in restoring the erring brother or sister to walk in obedience, in warning all to &ldquo;stand in fear&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.20">1 Tim. 5:20</a>), in increasing moral purity in the church, and in protecting and advancing Christ&rsquo;s honor. Though sorrow and pain are often connected with church discipline, when it is rightly done, with faith that the Lord is working through it, the sorrow will &ldquo;bring no regret&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co7.10">2 Cor. 7:10</a>). When carried out in this way, church discipline should certainly be seen as a means of grace by which the Holy Spirit will bring blessing to his church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">7. Giving</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Giving is ordinarily done through the church as it receives and distributes gifts to the various ministries and needs cared for by the church. Once again, there is no automatic or mechanical bestowing of benefits on those who give. Simon the sorcerer was strongly rebuked for thinking that he &ldquo;could obtain the gift of God with money&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.20">Acts 8:20</a>). But if giving is done in faith, out of commitment to Christ and love for his people, then certainly there will be great blessing in it. It is most pleasing to God when gifts of money are accompanied by an intensification of the giver&rsquo;s own personal commitment to God, as was the case among the Macedonians who &ldquo;first … <span style="font-style:italic;">gave themselves</span> to the Lord and to us by the will of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co8.5">2 Cor. 8:5</a>), and then gave to help the poor Christians in Jerusalem. When giving is carried out joyfully, &ldquo;not reluctantly or under compulsion,&rdquo; there is the great reward of God&rsquo;s favor with it, &ldquo;for God loves a cheerful giver&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co9.7">2 Cor. 9:7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul views the giving of money to the Lord&rsquo;s work as spiritual sowing that will lead to a harvest: &ldquo;he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co9.6">2 Cor. 9:6</a>). And Paul expects that as the Corinthians give rightly God will bless them: &ldquo;And God is able to make <span style="font-style:italic;">all grace abound to you</span> that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co9.8">2 Cor. 9:8</a> NASB). He tells them, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">You will be enriched in every way for great generosity</span> which through us will produce thanksgiving to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co9.11">2 Cor. 9:11</a>). Therefore giving blesses the <span style="font-style:italic;">recipient</span> in that his or her needs are met and faith and thanksgiving for God&rsquo;s provision are increased; it blesses the <span style="font-style:italic;">giver</span> because &ldquo;God loves a cheerful giver&rdquo; and will grant an abundant spiritual harvest, and brings blessing to <span style="font-style:italic;">all who know about it</span> since it produces a harvest of &ldquo;many thanksgivings to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co9.12">2 Cor. 9:12</a>). Rather than seeing giving as an unpleasant obligation, we would do well to view it as a rich means of grace within the church, and to expect that through it the Holy Spirit will bring blessing.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">8. Spiritual Gifts</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Peter views spiritual gifts as channels through which God&rsquo;s grace comes to the church because he says, &ldquo;As each has received a gift, employ it <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 958  </span>for one another, <span style="font-style:italic;">as good stewards of God&rsquo;s varied grace</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.10">1 Peter 4:10</a>). When gifts are used for one another in the church, God&rsquo;s grace is thereby dispensed to those for whom God intended it. Great blessing will come to the church through proper use of spiritual gifts, as the church follows Paul&rsquo;s command to use the gifts to &ldquo;strive to excel in building up the church&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co14.12">1 Cor. 14:12</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.11-16">Eph. 4:11&ndash;16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If we listed all the spiritual gifts as separate means of grace, our list of the means of grace would be much longer than eleven items. But even if we contain them all in this one category, we should recognize that the different spiritual gifts in the church are all means by which the Holy Spirit brings blessing through individual Christians. This should remind us of the abundant favor that God has given us as undeserving sinners, and should also make us realize that many different Christians, with diverse gifts, can be the channels through which grace comes to us. In fact, in Peter&rsquo;s exhortation to use spiritual gifts as stewards of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">varied</span> grace&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.10">1 Peter 4:10</a>), the word translated &ldquo;varied&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ποικίλος</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4476">G4476</a>) means &ldquo;having many facets or aspects; richly varied; having great diversity.&rdquo; Moreover, we should remember that these gifts are distributed not only to clergy or a limited number of Christians, but to all believers who have the Holy Spirit within them (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.7">1 Cor. 12:7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.11">11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.10">1 Peter 4:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">9. Fellowship</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> We should not neglect ordinary Christian fellowship as a valuable means of grace within the church. The early church &ldquo;devoted themselves to the apostles&rsquo; teaching <span style="font-style:italic;">and fellowship</span> to the breaking of bread and the prayers&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.42">Acts 2:42</a>). And the author of Hebrews reminds believers, &ldquo;Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, <span style="font-style:italic;">not neglecting to meet together</span> as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.24-25">Heb. 10:24&ndash;25</a>). In the fellowship of believers, ordinary friendship and affection for one another will grow, and Jesus&rsquo; injunction that we &ldquo;love one another&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.12">John 15:12</a>) will be fulfilled. Moreover, as believers care for one another, they will &ldquo;Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga6.2">Gal. 6:2</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		An emphasis on the fellowship of believers with one another as a means of grace would also help to overcome an excessive focus on the ordained clergy as the primary dispensers of grace within the church, and particularly when the church as a whole is assembled. It would also be healthy for Christians to recognize that a measure of God&rsquo;s grace is experienced when Christians talk together and eat together, when they have times of work and play together, enjoying one another&rsquo;s fellowship. &ldquo;And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.46-47">Acts 2:46&ndash;47</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">10. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Evangelism</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In Acts, there is a frequent connection between proclaiming the gospel (even in the face of opposition) and being filled with the Holy Spirit (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.4">Acts 2:4</a> with vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.14-36">14&ndash;36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.8">4:8</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.31">31</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.17">9:17</a> with v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.20">20</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.9">13:9</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.52">52</a>). Evangelism is a means of grace, then, not only in the sense that it ministers saving grace to the unsaved, but also because those who evangelize experience more of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s presence and blessing in their own lives. Sometimes evangelism is carried <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 959  </span>out by individuals, but at other times it is a corporate activity of the church (as in evangelistic campaigns). And even individual evangelism often involves other church members who will welcome an unbelieving visitor and give attention to his or her needs. So evangelism is rightly considered a means of grace in the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">11. Personal Ministry to Individuals</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Along with the previous ten &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; within the church, it is appropriate to list one more specific means that the Holy Spirit very frequently uses to bring blessing to individual Christians. This means of grace operates when one or more Christians within the church take time to minister, in various ways, to very specific needs of another individual in the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Sometimes this ministry takes the form of <span style="font-style:italic;">words of encouragement or exhortation or wise counsel</span>. We are to &ldquo;teach and admonish one another in all wisdom&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.16">Col. 3:16</a>), and to speak words that &ldquo;impart grace to those who hear&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.29">Eph. 4:29</a>). We are to attempt to bring back &ldquo;a sinner from the error of his way&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.20">James 5:20</a>) and to &ldquo;consider how to stir up one another to love and good works&rdquo; and to be &ldquo;encouraging one another&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.24-25">Heb. 10:24&ndash;25</a>). At other times such ministry involves <span style="font-style:italic;">giving to assist the material needs of a brother or sister:</span> James rebukes those who merely say, &ldquo;Go in peace, be warmed and filled,&rdquo; without &ldquo;giving them the things needed for the body&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.16">James 2:16</a>). John warns us, &ldquo;If any one has the world&rsquo;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God&rsquo;s love abide in him?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.17">1 John 3:17</a>). Therefore the early church gave readily to the needs of poor Christians, so that &ldquo;There was not a needy person among them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.34">Acts 4:34</a>). And Paul said that the leaders of the church in Jerusalem &ldquo;would have us remember the poor, which very thing I was eager to do&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.10">Gal. 2:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another form this interpersonal ministry may take is the <span style="font-style:italic;">anointing with oil</span> in conjunction with prayer for a sick person. Jesus&rsquo; disciples &ldquo;anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk6.13">Mark 6:13</a>). Similarly, James says that a sick person should &ldquo;call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas5.14">James 5:14</a>). In these cases the oil seems to have been a physical symbol of the healing power of the Holy Spirit coming to the sick person.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, one more means of exercising personal ministry to individuals in the New Testament is the use of physical touch, particularly the <span style="font-style:italic;">laying on of hands</span> in connection with prayer for someone in need. A survey of the New Testament may bring surprise to many modern Christians (as it did to the present author) when they see how frequently the laying on of hands and other kinds of physical touch are seen to function as a &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; in the ministry of Jesus and the early church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It seems that the laying on of hands was by far the most common method that Jesus used to pray for people. When crowds came bringing people &ldquo;with various diseases&rdquo; to him, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">he laid his hands on every one of them</span> and healed them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk4.40">Luke 4:40</a>). Other passages specifically describe Jesus&rsquo; placing his hands on people to heal them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt8.3">Matt. 8:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk1.41">Mark 1:41</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk6.5">6:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk8.23-25">8:23&ndash;25</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk5.13">Luke 5:13</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk13.13">13:13</a>). But more significant than these individual passages is the fact that people who came to Jesus for healing would come specifically asking him to lay his hands on a sick person: <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 960  </span>&ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Come and lay your hand on her</span> and she will live&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt9.18">Matt. 9:18</a>), or &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Come and lay your hands on her</span> so that she may be made well, and live&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk5.23">Mark 5:23</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk7.32">7:32</a>). The fact that people came with this request suggests that the laying on of hands was commonly recognized as the method Jesus usually used to heal people. In imitation of Jesus&rsquo; method of healing, when the father of Publius was sick, &ldquo;Paul visited him and prayed, and <span style="font-style:italic;">putting his hands on him</span> healed him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac28.8">Acts 28:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In other cases people sought more generally to touch Jesus, or asked that he would touch them, in order to be healed. &ldquo;And some people brought to him a blind man, and begged him to <span style="font-style:italic;">touch</span> him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk8.22">Mark 8:22</a>). Similarly, people &ldquo;brought to him all that were sick, and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt14.35-36">Matt. 14:35&ndash;36</a>). This was because the power of the Holy Spirit was conveyed through Jesus&rsquo; physical touch, and came forth and healed people. &ldquo;All the crowd sought to <span style="font-style:italic;">touch</span> him, for power came forth from him and healed them all&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk6.19">Luke 6:19</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt9.20-22">Matt. 9:20&ndash;22</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt9.25">25</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt20.34">20:34</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk1.31">Mark 1:31</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk5.41">5:41</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk9.27">9:27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk7.14">Luke 7:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk8.54">8:54</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk22.51">22:51</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, it was not simply to heal that Jesus and the early church laid on hands or touched people. When children came to Jesus &ldquo;he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk10.16">Mark 10:16</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt19.13-15">Matt. 19:13&ndash;15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk18.15">Luke 18:15</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Jesus so frequently touched people to bring healing or otherwise to bring blessing to them, it is not surprising that people would mention the miracles done by his hands: &ldquo;What mighty works (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">δύναμις</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1539">G1539</a>, &ldquo;miracle&rdquo;) are wrought <span style="font-style:italic;">by his hands!</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk6.2">Mark 6:2</a>). Similarly, when Paul and Barnabas were on their first missionary journey, the Lord &ldquo;bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done <span style="font-style:italic;">by their hands</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac14.3">Acts 14:3</a>). In the same way, &ldquo;God did extraordinary miracles by the <span style="font-style:italic;">hands</span> of Paul&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac19.11">Acts 19:11</a>). Since there was, as with the other means of grace, no automatic or magical power inherent in the hands of the early Christians, but healing and other kinds of blessing only came as God himself was pleased to work through the laying on of hands, it is not surprising that the early church prayed specifically that God would stretch forth <span style="font-style:italic;">his hand</span> to heal. They prayed, &ldquo;And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness, <span style="font-style:italic;">while you stretch out your hand to heal</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.29-30">Acts 4:29&ndash;30</a>). They realized that while they stretched forth their hands <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 961  </span>to touch those who were sick it would not be effective at all unless God&rsquo;s own mighty hand of power was working through their hands.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At other times the laying on of hands was done for some other purpose. Apparently it was done in connection with asking God to empower or equip people for some service or ministry. When the first deacons were appointed, the church brought them before the apostles, &ldquo;and they prayed and <span style="font-style:italic;">laid their hands upon them</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac6.6">Acts 6:6</a>). Similarly, when the church at Antioch sent out Paul and Barnabas, &ldquo;When they had fasted and prayed and <span style="font-style:italic;">laid their hands on them</span> they sent them away&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac13.3">Acts 13:3</a> NASB).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When the gospel came to a new group of people, those who proclaimed the gospel would sometimes lay hands on the new believers in order that they might receive the new covenant power of the Holy Spirit. At Samaria, the apostles &ldquo;laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac8.17">Acts 8:17</a>). Ananias laid his hands on Saul in order that he might regain his sight and &ldquo;be filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac9.17">Acts 9:17</a>). When Paul &ldquo;laid his hands upon&rdquo; the disciples at Ephesus who had just come to believe in Jesus, &ldquo;the Holy Spirit came on them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac19.6">Acts 19:6</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In other cases the laying on of hands resulted in the impartation of some spiritual gift. In the incident just mentioned, the disciples at Ephesus also &ldquo;spoke with tongues and prophesied&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac19.6">Acts 19:6</a>) after Paul laid his hands on them. Moreover, he reminds Timothy, &ldquo;Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophetic utterance (literally, &ldquo;through prophecy&rdquo;) when the council of elders laid their hands upon you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti4.14">1 Tim. 4:14</a>). Paul may have been referring to the same event or a different one when he said later, &ldquo;I remind you to rekindle the <span style="font-style:italic;">gift</span> of God that is within you <span style="font-style:italic;">through the laying on of my hands</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti1.6">2 Tim. 1:6</a>). (In <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti5.22">1 Timothy 5:22</a>, the statement &ldquo;Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands&rdquo; refers to the ordination of elders; see chapter <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.6.47.0.0.0.0.0">47</a>, p. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?ref=Page.p+918">918</a>.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If people in the early church were frequently praying for one another&rsquo;s needs, and if they imitated the example of Jesus and his disciples in the laying on of hands to pray for people for healing, for bringing blessing, for receiving the Holy Spirit at the time of conversion, for receiving spiritual gifts, or for empowering for ministry, then we would expect that instruction given to new Christians would have included the teaching that prayer for individual needs would ordinarily be accompanied by the placing of a hand or hands upon the person who was being prayed for. If this were so, then it would not be surprising that &ldquo;the laying on of hands&rdquo; would be classified as an &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; doctrine, something that belongs to the &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; of Christian instruction&mdash;which is in fact what we find in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.1-2">Hebrews 6:1&ndash;2</a>. Although some have understood this to refer more narrowly to the laying on of hands that accompanies installation in some specific church office, that is only one small aspect of the pattern of situations in which laying on of hands is found in the New Testament. It seems much better to understand this phrase in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.2">Hebrews 6:2</a> to refer to elementary instruction about how to pray for others in various situations of need so that young Christians would immediately be able to begin ministering to others as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It seems appropriate, then, to count the laying on of hands as one other dimension of the rich diversity of &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; that God has placed within the church to bring blessing to his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 962  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">12. Should </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Footwashing</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Practiced As a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Means of Grace</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Within the Church?</span> From time to time some Christian groups have practiced a ceremony of washing one another&rsquo;s feet at a public meeting of the church. They have based this practice on Jesus&rsquo;s command, &ldquo;If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, <span style="font-style:italic;">you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.14">John 13:14</a>). Those who advocate footwashing consider it a ceremony that Jesus commanded, similar to the ceremonies of baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, there are several reasons why we should not think that in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.14">John 13:14</a> Jesus was establishing another ceremony for the church in addition to baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. (1) Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper explicitly symbolize the greatest event in the history of redemption, Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection for us, but footwashing symbolizes no such redemptive-historical event. (2) Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper were clearly <span style="font-style:italic;">symbolic</span> actions, but when Jesus washed the disciples&rsquo; feet it was clearly <span style="font-style:italic;">functional</span> not merely symbolic, in that it met an ordinary human need of the day (dirty feet). (3) Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper are appropriate symbols of beginning and continuing in the Christian life, but no such symbolism attaches to footwashing. (4) To make footwashing an ordinance like baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper reduces it to a symbol&mdash;and if it is a symbol, then Jesus&rsquo; words command us only to perform a symbol, and the real force of Jesus&rsquo; command (to act in humility and love) is lost. (5) Whereas the epistles give evidence that baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper were continuing ordinances observed by the New Testament churches, there is no evidence that the apostles or the early church observed footwashing as an ordinance. (6) There is a simple and straightforward explanation for Jesus&rsquo; command: he is telling his disciples to take lowly tasks in serving one another. But if this is what the text means (and the vast majority of the church through history has understood it this way), then we need not look for an additional meaning (that Jesus is also instituting a new ceremony). By contrast, the New Testament texts about baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper cannot be understood to command something <span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> than a ceremony. Therefore, while all Christians would profit from pondering the application of Jesus&rsquo; statement about footwashing to their present patterns of life, none should think that Jesus is encouraging them to practice a ceremony of footwashing.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. Conclusions</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At the end of this discussion of the means of grace within the church, we should realize first of all that when any of these are carried out in faith and obedience, we should eagerly expect and look for evidence that the Holy Spirit is actually ministering to people at the same time as these actions are being done. We as Christians ought not to neglect to &ldquo;meet together&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.25">Heb. 10:25</a>), but ought to look forward eagerly to any assembly of believers in which any of these means would occur, expecting that God will bring blessing from each of these means!
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, we must realize that all of these means of grace occur within the fellowship of the church. Those who neglect the fellowship of the church <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 963  </span>willfully cut themselves off from all of these means of grace and thereby cut themselves off from most of the ordinary means that the Holy Spirit uses to bring blessing to his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These means of grace ought to give us great appreciation for the amazing privilege of being members of the body of Christ, the church.

		This hymn expresses joy at the privilege of being in the church. In fact, the author exclaims, &ldquo;Beyond my highest joy I prize her heavenly ways, /Her sweet communion, solemn vows, her hymns of love and praise.&rdquo; Here he is meditating on some of the means of grace within the church (&ldquo;her heavenly ways&rdquo;), particularly the fellowship or communion that comes within the church, the vows to God that are made there, and the hymns that are sung within it. Moreover, using the figure of Mount Zion to refer to the church, he says that &ldquo;to Zion shall be given /The brightest glories earth can yield, and brighter bliss of heaven.&rdquo; When we sing this we can think of all the rich blessings that the Holy Spirit bestows on the church through the many means of grace.

		The author of this hymn, Timothy Dwight, was President of Yale University from 1795 to 1817, during which time he reformed the administration and the curriculum and tripled the enrollment. He also was Professor of Divinity, and under his preaching a revival broke out in 1802, in which a third of the students were converted.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We may define the atonement as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">The atonement is the work Christ did in his life and death to earn our salvation</span>. This definition indicates that we are using the word <span style="font-style:italic;">atonement</span> in a broader sense than it is sometimes used. Sometimes it is used to refer only to Jesus&rsquo; dying and paying for our sins on the cross. But, as will be seen below, since saving benefits also come to us from Christ&rsquo;s life, we have included that in our definition as well.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. The Cause of the Atonement</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What was the ultimate cause that led to Christ&rsquo;s coming to earth and dying for our sins? To find this we must trace the question back to something in the character of God himself. And here Scripture points to two things: the <span style="font-style:italic;">love</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">justice</span> of God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The love of God as a cause of the atonement is seen in the most familiar passage in the Bible: &ldquo;For God <span style="font-style:italic;">so loved the world</span> that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.16">John 3:16</a>). But the justice of God also required that God find a way that the penalty due to us for our sins would be paid (for he could not accept us into fellowship with himself unless the penalty was paid). Paul explains that this was why God sent Christ to be a &ldquo;propitiation&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.25">Rom. 3:25</a> NASB) (that is, a sacrifice that bears God&rsquo;s wrath so that God becomes &ldquo;propitious&rdquo; or favorably disposed toward us): it was &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">to show God&rsquo;s righteousness</span> because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.25">Rom. 3:25</a>). Here Paul says that God had been forgiving sins in the Old Testament but no penalty had been paid&mdash;a fact that would make people wonder whether God was indeed just and ask how he could forgive sins without a penalty. No God who was truly just could do that, could he? Yet when God sent Christ to <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 569  </span>die and pay the penalty for our sins, &ldquo;it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.26">Rom. 3:26</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore both the love and the justice of God were the ultimate cause of the atonement. It is not helpful for us to ask which is more important, however, because without the love of God, he would never have taken any steps to redeem us, yet without the justice of God, the specific requirement that Christ should earn our salvation by dying for our sins would not have been met. Both the love and the justice of God were equally important.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. The Necessity of the Atonement</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Was there any other way for God to save human beings than by sending his Son to die in our place?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Before answering this question, it is important to realize that it was not necessary for God to save any people at all. When we appreciate that &ldquo;God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of nether gloom to be kept until the judgment&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a>), then we realize that God could also have chosen with perfect justice to have left us in our sins awaiting judgment: he could have chosen to save no one, just as he did with the sinful angels. So in this sense the atonement was not absolutely necessary.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But once God, in his love, decided to save some human beings, then several passages in Scripture indicate that there was no other way for God to do this than through the death of his Son. Therefore, the atonement was not absolutely necessary, but, as a &ldquo;consequence&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s decision to save some human beings, the atonement was absolutely necessary. This is sometimes called the &ldquo;consequent absolute necessity&rdquo; view of the atonement.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus prays, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">If it be possible</span> let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.39">Matt. 26:39</a>). We may be confident that Jesus always prayed according to the will of the Father, and that he always prayed with fullness of faith. Thus it seems that this prayer, which Matthew takes pains to record for us, shows that it was <span style="font-style:italic;">not possible</span> for Jesus to avoid the death on the cross which was soon to come to him (the &ldquo;cup&rdquo; of suffering that he had said would be his). If he was going to accomplish the work that the Father sent him to do, and if people were going to be redeemed for God, then it was necessary for him to die on the cross.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		He said something similar after his resurrection, when he was talking with two disciples on the road to Emmaus. They were sad that Jesus had died, but his response was, &ldquo;O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not <span style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span> that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.25-26">Luke 24:25&ndash;26</a>). Jesus understood that God&rsquo;s plan of redemption (which he explained for the disciples from many Old Testament Scriptures, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk24.27">Luke 24:27</a>) made it necessary for the Messiah to die for the sins of his people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As we saw above, Paul in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3">Romans 3</a> also shows that if God were to be righteous, and still save people, he had to send Christ to pay the penalty for sins: &ldquo;It was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.26">Rom. 3:26</a>). The epistle to the Hebrews emphasizes that Christ had to suffer for our sins: &ldquo;He <span style="font-style:italic;">had to</span> be made like his <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 570  </span>brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation [lit. &ldquo;propitiation&rsquo;] for the sins of the people&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.17">Heb. 2:17</a>). The author of Hebrews also argues that since &ldquo;it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.4">Heb. 10:4</a>), a better sacrifice is required (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.23">Heb. 9:23</a>). Only the blood of Christ, that is, his death, would be able really to take away sins (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.25-26">Heb. 9:25&ndash;26</a>). There was no other way for God to save us than for Christ to die in our place.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:18pt; text-align:center;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. The Nature of the Atonement</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this section we consider two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s work: (1) <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.4.27.1.3.1.0.0">Christ&rsquo;s obedience for us</a>, in which he obeyed the requirements of the law in our place and was perfectly obedient to the will of God the Father as our representative, and (2) <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=R.4.27.1.3.2.0.0">Christ&rsquo;s sufferings for us</a>, in which he took the penalty due for our sins and as a result died for our sins.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is important to notice that in both of these categories the primary emphasis and the primary influence of Christ&rsquo;s work of redemption is not on us, but on God the Father. Jesus obeyed the Father in our place and perfectly met the demands of the law. And he suffered in our place, receiving in himself the penalty that God the Father would have visited upon us. In both cases, the atonement is viewed as objective; that is, something that has primary influence directly on God himself. Only secondarily does it have application to us, and this is only because there was a definite event in the relationship between God the Father and God the Son that secured our salvation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Christ&rsquo;s </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> for Us (Sometimes Called His &ldquo;Active </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&rdquo;)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> If Christ had only earned forgiveness of sins for us, then we would not merit heaven. Our guilt would have been removed, but we would simply be in the position of Adam and Eve before they had done anything good or bad and before they had passed a time of probation successfully. To be established in righteousness forever and to have their fellowship with God made sure forever, Adam and Eve had to obey God perfectly over a period of time. Then God would have looked on their faithful obedience with pleasure and delight, and they would have lived with him in fellowship forever.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For this reason, Christ had to live a life of perfect obedience to God in order to earn righteousness for us. He had to obey the law for his whole life on our behalf so that the positive merits of his perfect obedience would be counted for us. Sometimes this is called Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;active obedience,&rdquo; while his suffering and dying for our sins is called his &ldquo;passive obedience.&rdquo; Paul says his goal is that he may be <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 571  </span>found in Christ, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">not having a righteousness of [his] own</span> based on law, but <span style="font-style:italic;">that which is through faith in Christ</span> the righteousness from God that depends on faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.9">Phil. 3:9</a>). It is not just moral neutrality that Paul knows he needs from Christ (that is, a clean slate with sins forgiven), but a positive moral righteousness. And he knows that that cannot come from himself, but must come through faith in Christ. Similarly, Paul says that Christ has been made &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">our righteousness</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co1.30">1 Cor. 1:30</a>). And he quite explicitly says, &ldquo;For as by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man&rsquo;s obedience many will be <span style="font-style:italic;">made righteous</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.19">Rom. 5:19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some theologians have not taught that Christ needed to achieve a lifelong record of perfect obedience for us. They have simply emphasized that Christ had to die and thereby pay the penalty for our sins. But such a position does not adequately explain why Christ did more than just die for us; he also became our &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; before God. Jesus said to John the Baptist, before he was baptized by him, &ldquo;It is fitting for us <span style="font-style:italic;">to fulfil all righteousness</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt3.15">Matt. 3:15</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It might be argued that Christ had to live a life of perfect righteousness for his own sake, not for ours, before he could be a sinless sacrifice for us. But Jesus had no need to live a life of perfect obedience for his own sake&mdash;he had shared love and fellowship with the Father for all eternity and was in his own character eternally worthy of the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure and delight. He rather had to &ldquo;fulfill all righteousness&rdquo; for our sake; that is, for the sake of the people whom he was representing as their head. Unless he had done this for us, we would have no record of obedience by which we would merit God&rsquo;s favor and merit eternal life with him. Moreover, if Jesus had needed only sinlessness and not also a life of perfect obedience, he could have died for us when he was a young child rather than when he was thirty-three years old.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		By way of application, we ought to ask ourselves whose lifelong record of obedience we would rather rely on for our standing before God, Christ&rsquo;s or our own? As we think about the life of Christ, we ought to ask ourselves, was it good enough to deserve God&rsquo;s approval? And are we willing to rely on his record of obedience for our eternal destiny?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Christ&rsquo;s Sufferings for Us (Sometimes Called His &ldquo;Passive </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&rdquo;)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In addition to obeying the law perfectly for his whole life on our behalf, Christ also took on himself the sufferings necessary to pay the penalty for our sins.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Suffering for His Whole Life</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> In a broad sense the penalty Christ bore in paying for our sins was suffering in both his body and soul throughout his life. Though Christ&rsquo;s sufferings culminated in his death on the cross (see below), his whole life in a fallen world involved suffering. For example, Jesus endured tremendous suffering during the temptation in the wilderness (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt4.1-11">Matt. 4:1&ndash;11</a>), when he was assaulted for forty days by the attacks of Satan. He also suffered in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 572  </span>growing to maturity, &ldquo;Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he <span style="font-style:italic;">suffered</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb5.8">Heb. 5:8</a>). He knew suffering in the intense opposition he faced from Jewish leaders throughout much of his earthly ministry (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.3-4">Heb. 12:3&ndash;4</a>). We may suppose too that he experienced suffering and grief at the death of his earthly father, and certainly he experienced grief at the death of his close friend Lazarus (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn11.35">John 11:35</a>). In predicting the coming of the Messiah, Isaiah said he would be &ldquo;a <span style="font-style:italic;">man of sorrows</span> and acquainted with grief&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.3">Isa. 53:3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">b. The Pain of the Cross</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> The sufferings of Jesus intensified as he drew near to the cross. He told his disciples of something of the agony he was going through when he said, &ldquo;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.38">Matt. 26:38</a>). It was especially on the cross that Jesus&rsquo; sufferings for us reached their climax, for it was there that he bore the penalty for our sin and died in our place. Scripture teaches us that there were four different aspects of the pain that Jesus experienced:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) Physical Pain and Death</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We do not need to hold that Jesus suffered more physical pain than any human being has ever suffered, for the Bible nowhere makes such a claim. But we still must not forget that death by crucifixion was one of the most horrible forms of execution ever devised by man.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Many readers of the Gospels in the ancient world would have witnessed crucifixions and thus would have had a painfully vivid mental picture upon reading the simple words &ldquo;And they crucified him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk15.24">Mark 15:24</a>). A criminal who was crucified was essentially forced to inflict upon himself a very slow death by suffocation. When the criminal&rsquo;s arms were outstretched and fastened by nails to the cross, he had to support most of the weight of his body with his arms. The chest cavity would be pulled upward and outward, making it difficult to exhale in order to be able to draw a fresh breath. But when the victim&rsquo;s longing for oxygen became unbearable, he would have to push himself up with his feet, thus giving more natural support to the weight of his body, releasing some of the weight from his arms, and enabling his chest cavity to contract more normally. By pushing himself upward in this way the criminal could fend off suffocation, but it was extremely painful because it required putting the body&rsquo;s weight on the nails holding the feet, and bending the elbows and pulling upward on the nails driven through the wrists. The criminal&rsquo;s back, which had been torn open repeatedly by a previous flogging, would scrape against the wooden cross with each breath. Thus Seneca (first century <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span>) spoke of a crucified man &ldquo;drawing the breath of life amid long-drawn-out agony&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Seneca.Sen.,_Ep._101">Epistle 101</a>, to Lucilius, section 14).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A physician writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association</span> in 1986 explained the pain that would have been experienced in death by crucifixion:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 573  </span>Adequate exhalation required lifting the body by pushing up on the feet and by flexing the elbows … However, this maneuver would place the entire weight of the body on the tarsals and would produce searing pain. Furthermore, flexion of the elbows would cause rotation of the wrists about the iron nails and cause fiery pain along the damaged median nerves … Muscle cramps and paresthesias of the outstretched and uplifted arms would add to the discomfort. As a result, each respiratory effort would become agonizing and tiring and lead eventually to asphyxia.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In some cases, crucified men would survive for several days, nearly suffocating but not quite dying. This was why the executioners would sometimes break the legs of a criminal, so that death would come quickly, as we see in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn19.31-33">John 19:31&ndash;33</a>:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(2) The Pain of Bearing Sin</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		More awful than the pain of physical suffering that Jesus endured was the psychological pain of bearing the guilt for our sin. In our own experience as Christians we know something of the anguish we feel when we know we have sinned. The weight of guilt is heavy on our hearts, and there is a bitter sense of separation from all that is right in the universe, an awareness of something that in a very deep sense ought not to be. In fact, the more we grow in holiness as God&rsquo;s children, the more intensely we feel this instinctive revulsion against evil.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now Jesus was perfectly holy. He hated sin with his entire being. The thought of evil, of sin, contradicted everything in his character. Far more than we do, Jesus instinctively rebelled against evil. Yet in obedience to the Father, and out of love for us, Jesus took on himself all the sins of those who would someday be saved. Taking on himself all the evil against which his soul rebelled created deep revulsion in the center of his being. All that he hated most deeply was poured out fully upon him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture frequently says that our sins were put on Christ: &ldquo;The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> has laid on him the iniquity of us all&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.6">Isa. 53:6</a>), and &ldquo;He <span style="font-style:italic;">bore the sin</span> of many&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.12">Isa. 53:12</a>). John the Baptist calls Jesus &ldquo;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.29">John 1:29</a>). Paul declares that God made Christ &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">to be sin</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.21">2 Cor. 5:21</a>) and that Christ became &ldquo;a curse for us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.13">Gal. 3:13</a>). The author of Hebrews says that Christ was &ldquo;offered once to bear the sins of many&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.28">Heb. 9:28</a>). And Peter says, &ldquo;He himself <span style="font-style:italic;">bore our sins</span> in his body on the tree&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.24">1 Peter 2:24</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The passage from 2 Corinthians quoted above, together with the verses from <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 574  </span>Isaiah, indicate that it was God the Father who put our sins on Christ. How could that be? In the same way in which Adam&rsquo;s sins were imputed to us, so God <span style="font-style:italic;">imputed</span> our sins to Christ; that is, he <span style="font-style:italic;">thought of them as belonging to Christ</span> and, since God is the ultimate judge and definer of what really is in the universe, when God thought of our sins as belonging to Christ then in fact they actually did belong to Christ. This does not mean that God thought that Christ had himself committed the sins, or that Christ himself actually had a sinful nature, but rather that the guilt for our sins (that is, the liability to punishment) was thought of by God as belonging to Christ rather than to us.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some have objected that it was not fair for God to do this, to transfer the guilt of sin from us to an innocent person, Christ. Yet we must remember that Christ voluntarily took on himself the guilt for our sins, so this objection loses much of its force. Moreover, God himself (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) is the ultimate standard of what is just and fair in the universe, and he decreed that the atonement would take place in this way, and that it did in fact satisfy the demands of his own righteousness and justice.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(3) Abandonment</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The physical pain of crucifixion and the pain of taking on himself the absolute evil of our sins were aggravated by the fact that Jesus faced this pain alone. In the Garden of Gethsemane, when Jesus took with him Peter, James and John, he confided something of his agony to them: &ldquo;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk14.34">Mark 14:34</a>). This is the kind of confidence one would disclose to a close friend, and it implies a request for support in his hour of greatest trial. Yet as soon as Jesus was arrested, &ldquo;all the disciples forsook him and fled&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.56">Matt. 26:56</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here also there is a very faint analogy in our experience, for we cannot live long without tasting the inward ache of rejection, whether it be rejection by a close friend, by a parent or child, or by a wife or husband. Yet in all those cases there is at least a sense that we could have done something differently, that at least in small part we may be at fault. It was not so with Jesus and the disciples, for, &ldquo;having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.1">John 13:1</a>). He had done nothing but love them; in return, they all abandoned him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But far worse than desertion by even the closest of human friends was the fact that Jesus was deprived of the closeness to the Father that had been the deepest joy of his heart for all his earthly life. When Jesus cried out &ldquo;Eli, Eli, lama sabach-thani?&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt27.46">Matt. 27:46</a>), he showed that he was finally cut off from the sweet fellowship with his heavenly Father that had been the unfailing source of his inward strength and the element of greatest joy in a life filled with sorrow. As Jesus bore our sins on the cross, he was abandoned by his heavenly Father, who is &ldquo;of purer eyes than to behold evil&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Hab1.13">Hab. 1:13</a>). He faced the weight of the guilt of millions of sins alone.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(4) Bearing the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Wrath of God</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet more difficult than these three previous aspects of Jesus&rsquo; pain was the pain of bearing the wrath of God upon himself. As Jesus bore the guilt of our sins <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 575  </span>alone, God the Father, the mighty Creator, the Lord of the universe, poured out on Jesus the fury of his wrath: Jesus became the object of the intense hatred of sin and vengeance against sin which God had patiently stored up since the beginning of the world.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.25">Romans 3:25</a> tells us that God put forward Christ as a &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">propitiation</span>&rdquo; (NASB) a word that means &ldquo;a sacrifice that bears God&rsquo;s wrath to the end and in so doing changes God&rsquo;s wrath toward us into favor.&rdquo; Paul tells us that &ldquo;This was to show God&rsquo;s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins; it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.25-26">Rom. 3:25&ndash;26</a>). God had not simply forgiven sin and forgotten about the punishment in generations past. He had forgiven sins and stored up his righteous anger against those sins. But at the cross the fury of all that stored-up wrath against sin was unleashed against God&rsquo;s own Son.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Many theologians outside the evangelical world have strongly objected to the idea that Jesus bore the wrath of God against sin. Their basic assumption is that since God is a God of love, it would be inconsistent with his character to show wrath against the human beings he has created and for whom he is a loving Father. But evangelical scholars have convincingly argued that the idea of the wrath of God is solidly rooted in both the Old and New Testaments: &ldquo;The whole of the argument of the opening part of Romans is that all men, Gentiles and Jews alike, are sinners, and that they come under the wrath and the condemnation of God.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Three other crucial passages in the New Testament refer to Jesus&rsquo; death as a &ldquo;propitiation&rdquo;: <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.17">Hebrews 2:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.2">1 John 2:2</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.10">4:10</a>. The Greek terms (the verb <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἱλάσκομαι</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2661">G2661</a>, &ldquo;to make propitiation&rdquo; and the noun <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἱλασμός</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2662">G2662</a>) &ldquo;a sacrifice of propitiation&rdquo;) used in these passages have the sense of &ldquo;a sacrifice that turns away the wrath of God&mdash;and thereby makes God propitious (or favorable) toward us.&rdquo; This is the consistent meaning of these words outside the Bible where they were well understood in reference to pagan Greek religions. These verses simply mean that Jesus bore the wrath of God against sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is important to insist on this fact, because it is the heart of the doctrine of the atonement. It means that there is an eternal, unchangeable requirement in the holiness and justice of God that sin be paid for. Furthermore, before the atonement ever could have an effect on our subjective consciousness, it first had an effect on God and his relation to the sinners he planned to redeem. Apart from this central truth, the death of Christ really cannot be adequately understood (see discussion of other views of the atonement below).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although we must be cautious in suggesting any analogies to the experience <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 576  </span>Christ went through (for his experience was and always will be without precedent or comparison), nonetheless, all our understanding of Jesus&rsquo; suffering comes in some sense by way of analogous experiences in our life&mdash;for that is how God teaches us in Scripture. Once again our human experience provides a very faint analogy that helps us understand what it means to bear the wrath of God. Perhaps as children we have faced the wrath of a human father when we have done wrong, or perhaps as adults we have known the anger of an employer because of a mistake we have made. We are inwardly shaken, disturbed by the crashing of another personality, filled with displeasure, into our very selves, and we tremble. We can hardly imagine the personal disintegration that would threaten if the outpouring of wrath came not from some finite human being but from Almighty God. If even the presence of God when he does not manifest wrath arouses fear and trembling in people (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.21">Heb. 12:21</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.28-29">28&ndash;29</a>), how terrible it must be to face the presence of a wrathful God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.31">Heb. 10:31</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With this in mind, we are now better able to understand Jesus&rsquo; cry of desolation, &ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt27.46b">Matt. 27:46b</a>). The question does not mean, &ldquo;Why have you left me forever?&rdquo; for Jesus knew that he was leaving the world, that he was going to the Father (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn14.28">John 14:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn16.10">16:10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn16.17">17</a>). Jesus knew that he would rise again (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn2.19">John 2:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk18.33">Luke 18:33</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk9.31">Mark 9:31</a>; et al.). It was &ldquo;for the joy that was set before him&rdquo; that Jesus &ldquo;endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.2">Heb. 12:2</a>). Jesus knew that he could still call God &ldquo;my God.&rdquo; This cry of desolation is not a cry of total despair. Furthermore, &ldquo;Why have you forsaken me?&rdquo; does not imply that Jesus wondered why he was dying. He had said, &ldquo;The Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk10.45">Mark 10:45</a>). Jesus knew that he was dying for our sins.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus&rsquo; cry is a quotation from <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22.1">Psalm 22:1</a>, a psalm in which the psalmist asks why God is so far from helping him, why God delays in rescuing him:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:54pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		and by night, but find no rest.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-right:36pt; text-align:right;" lang="en-US">
		(<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22.1-2">Ps. 22:1&ndash;2</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet the psalmist was eventually rescued by God, and his cry of desolation turned into a hymn of praise (vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22.22-31">22&ndash;31</a>). Jesus, who knew the words of Scripture as his own, knew well the context of <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22">Psalm 22</a>. In quoting this psalm, he is quoting a cry of desolation that also has implicit in its context an unremitting faith in the God who will ultimately deliver him. Nevertheless, it remains a very real cry of anguish because the suffering has gone on so long and no release is in sight.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With this context for the quotation it is better to understand the question &ldquo;Why have you forsaken me?&rdquo; as meaning, &ldquo;Why have you left me <span style="font-style:italic;">for so long?</span>&rdquo; This is the sense it has in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps22">Psalm 22</a>. Jesus, in his human nature, knew he would have to bear our sins, to suffer and to die. But, in his human consciousness, he probably did not know how long this suffering would take. Yet to bear the guilt of millions of <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 577  </span>sins even for a moment would cause the greatest anguish of soul. To face the deep and furious wrath of an infinite God even for an instant would cause the most profound fear. But Jesus&rsquo; suffering was not over in a minute&mdash;or two&mdash;or ten. When would it end? Could there be yet more weight of sin? Yet more wrath of God? Hour after hour it went on&mdash;the dark weight of sin and the deep wrath of God poured over Jesus in wave after wave. Jesus at last cried out, &ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&rdquo; Why must this suffering go on so long? Oh God, my God, will you ever bring it to an end?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then at last Jesus knew his suffering was nearing completion. He knew he had consciously borne all the wrath of the Father against our sins, for God&rsquo;s anger had abated and the awful heaviness of sin was being removed. He knew that all that remained was to yield up his spirit to his heavenly Father and die. With a shout of victory Jesus cried out, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn19.30">John 19:30</a>). Then with a loud voice he once more cried out, &ldquo;Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.46">Luke 23:46</a>). And then he voluntarily gave up the life that no one could take from him (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.17-18">John 10:17&ndash;18</a>), and he died. As Isaiah had predicted, &ldquo;he poured out his soul to death&rdquo; and &ldquo;bore the sin of many&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.12">Isa. 53:12</a>). God the Father saw &ldquo;the fruit of the travail of his soul&rdquo; and was &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.11">Isa. 53:11</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) The Penalty Was Inflicted By God the Father</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If we ask, &ldquo;Who required Christ to pay the penalty for our sins?&rdquo; the answer given by Scripture is that the penalty was inflicted by God the Father as he represented the interests of the Trinity in redemption. It was God&rsquo;s justice that required that sin be paid for, and, among the members of the Trinity, it was God the Father whose role was to require that payment. God the Son voluntarily took upon himself the role of bearing the penalty for sin. Referring to God the Father, Paul says, &ldquo;For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin [that is, Christ], so that in him we might become the righteousness of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.21">2 Cor. 5:21</a>). Isaiah said, &ldquo;The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> has laid on him the iniquity of us all&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.6">Isa. 53:6</a>). He goes on to describe the sufferings of Christ: &ldquo;Yet it was the will of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> to bruise him; he has put him to grief&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.10">Isa. 53:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Herein we see something of the amazing love of both God the Father and God the Son in redemption. Not only did Jesus know that he would bear the incredible pain of the cross, but God the Father also knew that he would have to inflict this pain on his own deeply loved Son. &ldquo;God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.8">Rom. 5:8</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(2) Not Eternal Suffering but Complete Payment</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If we had to pay the penalty for our own sins, we would have to suffer eternally in separation from God. However, Jesus did not suffer eternally. There are two reasons for this difference: (a) If we suffered for our own sins, we would never be able to make ourselves right with God again. There would be no hope because there would be no way to live again and earn perfect righteousness before God, and there would be no way to undo our sinful nature and make it right before <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 578  </span>God. Moreover, we would continue to exist as sinners who would not suffer with pure hearts of righteousness before God, but would suffer with resentment and bitterness against God, thus continually compounding our sin. (b) Jesus was able to bear all the wrath of God against our sin and to bear it to the end. No mere man could ever have done this, but by virtue of the union of divine and human natures in himself, Jesus was able to bear all the wrath of God against sin and bear it to the end. Isaiah predicted that God &ldquo;shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul <span style="font-style:italic;">and be satisfied</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is53.11">Isa. 53:11</a>). When Jesus knew that he had paid the full penalty for our sin, he said, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">It is finished</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn19.30">John 19:30</a>). If Christ had not paid the full penalty, there would still be condemnation left for us. But since he has paid the full penalty that is due to us, &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It should help us at this point to realize that nothing in the eternal character of God and nothing in the laws God had given for mankind required that there be eternal suffering to pay for man&rsquo;s sins. In fact, if there is eternal suffering, it simply shows that the penalty has never been fully paid, and that the evildoer continues to be a sinner by nature. But when Christ&rsquo;s sufferings at last came to an end on the cross, it showed that he had borne the full measure of God&rsquo;s wrath against sin and there was no penalty left to pay. It also showed that he was himself righteous before God. In this way the fact that Christ suffered for a limited time rather than eternally shows that his suffering was a sufficient payment for sins. The author of Hebrews repeats this theme again and again, emphasizing the completion and the finality of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Holy Place yearly with blood not his own; for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself … Christ, having been offered once <span style="font-style:italic;">to bear the sins of many</span> will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.25-28">Heb. 9:25&ndash;28</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This New Testament emphasis on the completion and finality of Christ&rsquo;s sacrificial death stands in contrast to the Roman Catholic teaching that in the mass there is a repetition of the sacrifice of Christ. Because of this official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, many Protestants since the Reformation, and still today, are convinced that they cannot in good conscience actually participate in the Roman Catholic mass, because it would seem to be an endorsement of the Catholic view that the sacrifice of Christ is repeated every time the mass is offered.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament emphasis on the completion and finality of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice of himself for us has much practical application, because it assures us that there is no more penalty for sin left for us to pay. The penalty has entirely been paid by Christ, and we should have no remaining fear of condemnation or punishment.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The New Testament frequently connects the blood of Christ with our redemption. For example, Peter says, &ldquo;You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.18-19">1 Peter 1:18&ndash;19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The blood of Christ is the clear outward evidence that his life blood was poured out when he died a sacrificial death to pay for our redemption&mdash;&ldquo;the blood of Christ&rdquo; means his death in its saving aspects. Although we may think that Christ&rsquo;s blood (as evidence that his life had been given) would have exclusive reference to the removal of our judicial guilt before God&mdash;for this is its primary reference&mdash;the New Testament authors also attribute to it several other effects. By the blood of Christ our consciences are cleansed (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.14">Heb. 9:14</a>), we gain bold access to God in worship and prayer (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.19">Heb. 10:19</a>), we are progressively cleansed from remaining sin (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn1.7">1 John 1:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Re1.5b">Rev. 1:5b</a>), we are able to conquer the accuser of the brethren (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re12.10-11">Rev. 12:10&ndash;11</a>), and we are rescued out of a sinful way of life (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.18-19">1 Peter 1:18&ndash;19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture speaks so much about the blood of Christ because its shedding was very clear evidence that his life was being given in judicial execution (that is, he was condemned to death and died paying a penalty imposed both by an earthly human judge and by God himself in heaven). Scripture&rsquo;s emphasis on the blood of Christ also shows the clear connection between Christ&rsquo;s death and the many sacrifices in the Old Testament that involved the pouring out of the life blood of the sacrificial animal. These sacrifices all pointed forward to and prefigured the death of Christ.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The view of Christ&rsquo;s death presented here has frequently been called the theory of &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">penal substitution.</span>&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s death was &ldquo;penal&rdquo; in that he bore a penalty when he died. His death was also a &ldquo;substitution&rdquo; in that he was a substitute for us when he died. This has been the orthodox understanding of the atonement held by evangelical theologians, in contrast to other views that attempt to explain the atonement apart from the idea of the wrath of God or payment of the penalty for sin (see below).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This view of the atonement is sometimes called the theory of <span style="font-style:italic;">vicarious atonement</span>. A &ldquo;vicar&rdquo; is someone who stands in the place of another or who represents another. Christ&rsquo;s death was therefore &ldquo;vicarious&rdquo; because he stood in our place and represented us. As our representative, he took the penalty that we deserve.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To pay the penalty of death that we deserved because of our sins, Christ died as a sacrifice for us. &ldquo;He has appeared once for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.26">Heb. 9:26</a>).

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To remove us from the wrath of God that we deserved, Christ died as a propitiation for our sins. &ldquo;In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.10">1 John 4:10</a> NASB).

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To overcome our separation from God, we needed someone to provide reconciliation and thereby bring us back into fellowship with God. Paul says that God &ldquo;through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.18-19">2 Cor. 5:18&ndash;19</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(4) Redemption</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Because we as sinners are in bondage to sin and to Satan, we need someone to provide redemption and thereby &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; us out of that bondage. When we speak of redemption, the idea of a &ldquo;ransom&rdquo; comes into view. A ransom is the price paid to redeem someone from bondage or captivity. Jesus said of himself, &ldquo;For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life <span style="font-style:italic;">as a ransom for many</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk10.45">Mark 10:45</a>). If we ask to whom the ransom was paid, we realize that the human analogy of a ransom payment does not fit the atonement of Christ in every detail. Though we were in bondage to sin and to Satan, there was no &ldquo;ransom&rdquo; paid either to &ldquo;sin&rdquo; or to Satan himself, for they did not have power to demand such payment, nor was Satan the one whose holiness was offended by sin and who required a penalty to be paid for sin. As we saw earlier, the penalty for sin was paid by Christ and received and accepted by God the Father. But we hesitate to speak of paying a &ldquo;ransom&rdquo; to God the Father, because it was not he who held us in bondage but Satan and our own sins. Therefore at this point the idea of a ransom payment cannot be pressed in every detail. It is sufficient to note that a price was paid (the death of Christ) and the result was that we were &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; from bondage.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We were redeemed from bondage to Satan because &ldquo;the whole world is in the power of the evil one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.19">1 John 5:19</a>), and when Christ came he died to &ldquo;deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.15">Heb. </a><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 581  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.15">2:15</a>). In fact, God the Father &ldquo;has delivered us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.13">Col. 1:13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As for deliverance from bondage to sin, Paul says, &ldquo;So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus … For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.11">Rom. 6:11</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro6.14">14</a>). We have been delivered from bondage to the guilt of sin and from bondage to its ruling power in our lives.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">e. Other Views of the Atonement</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> In contrast to the penal substitution view of the atonement presented in this chapter, several other views have been advocated in the history of the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) The Ransom to Satan Theory</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This view was held by Origen (c. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 185&ndash;c. 254), a theologian from Alexandria and later Caesarea, and after him by some others in the early history of the church. According to this view, the ransom Christ paid to redeem us was paid to Satan, in whose kingdom all people were by virtue of sin.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This theory finds no direct confirmation in Scripture and has few supporters in the history of the church. It falsely thinks of Satan rather than God as the one who required that a payment be made for sin and thus completely neglects the demands of God&rsquo;s justice with respect to sin. It views Satan as having much more power than he actually does, namely, power to demand whatever he wants from God, rather than as one who has been cast down from heaven and has no right to demand anything of God. Nowhere does Scripture say that we as sinners owe anything to Satan, but it repeatedly says that God requires of us a payment for our sins. This view also fails to deal with the texts that speak of Christ&rsquo;s death as a propitiation offered to God the Father for our sins, or with the fact that God the Father represented the Trinity in accepting the payment for sins from Christ (see discussion above).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(2) The </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Moral Influence Theory</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		First advocated by Peter Abelard (1079&ndash;1142), a French theologian, the moral influence theory of the atonement holds that God did not require the payment of a penalty for sin, but that Christ&rsquo;s death was simply a way in which God showed how much he loved human beings by identifying with their sufferings, even to the point of death. Christ&rsquo;s death therefore becomes a great teaching example that shows God&rsquo;s love to us and draws from us a grateful response, so that in loving him we are forgiven.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The great difficulty with this viewpoint is that it is contrary to so many passages of Scripture that speak of Christ dying for sin, bearing our sin, or dying as a propitiation. Moreover, it robs the atonement of its objective character, because it holds that the atonement had no effect on God himself. Finally, it has no way of dealing with our guilt&mdash;if Christ did not die to pay for our sins, we have no right to trust in him for forgiveness of sins.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(3) The Example Theory</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The example theory of the atonement was taught by the Socinians, the followers <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 582  </span>of Faustus Socinus (1539&ndash;1604), an Italian theologian who settled in Poland in 1578 and attracted a wide following. The example theory, like the moral influence theory, also denies that God&rsquo;s justice requires payment for sin; it says that Christ&rsquo;s death simply provides us with an example of how we should trust and obey God perfectly, even if that trust and obedience leads to a horrible death. Whereas the moral influence theory says that Christ&rsquo;s death teaches us how much God loves us, the example theory says that Christ&rsquo;s death teaches us how we should live. Support for this view could be found in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.21">1 Peter 2:21</a>, &ldquo;For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		While it is true that Christ is an example for us even in his death, the question is whether this fact is the complete explanation of the atonement. The example theory fails to account for the many Scriptures that focus on Christ&rsquo;s death as a payment for sin, the fact that Christ bore our sins, and the fact that he was the propitiation for our sins. These considerations alone mean that the theory must be rejected. Moreover, this view really ends up arguing that man can save himself by following Christ&rsquo;s example and by trusting and obeying God just as Christ did. Thus it fails to show how the guilt of our sin can be removed, because it does not hold that Christ actually paid the penalty for our sins or made provision for our guilt when he died.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(4) The </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Governmental Theory</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The governmental theory of the atonement was first taught by a Dutch theologian and jurist, Hugo Grotius (1583&ndash;1645). This theory holds that God did not actually have to require payment for sin, but, since he was omnipotent God, he could have set aside that requirement and simply forgiven sins without the payment of a penalty. Then what was the purpose of Christ&rsquo;s death? It was God&rsquo;s demonstration of the fact that his laws had been broken, that he is the moral lawgiver and governor of the universe, and that some kind of penalty would be required whenever his laws were broken. Thus Christ did not exactly pay the penalty for the actual sins of any people, but simply suffered to show that when God&rsquo;s laws are broken there must be some penalty paid.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The problem with this view again is that it fails to account adequately for all the Scriptures that speak of Christ bearing our sins on the cross, of God laying on Christ the iniquity of us all, of Christ dying specifically for our sins, and of Christ being the propitiation for our sins. Moreover, it takes away the objective character of the atonement by making its purpose not the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s justice but simply that of influencing us to realize that God has laws that must be kept. This view also implies that we cannot rightly trust in Christ&rsquo;s completed work for forgiveness of sin, because he has not actually made payment for those sins. Moreover, it makes the actual earning of forgiveness for us something that happened in God&rsquo;s own mind apart from the death of Christ on the cross&mdash;he had already decided to forgive us without requiring any penalty from us and then punished Christ only to demonstrate that he was still the moral governor of the universe. But this means that Christ (in this view) did not actually earn forgiveness <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 586  </span>or salvation for us, and thus the value of his redemptive work is greatly minimized. Finally, this theory fails to take adequate account of the unchangeableness of God and the infinite purity of his justice. To say that God can forgive sins without requiring any penalty (in spite of the fact that throughout Scripture sin always requires the payment of a penalty) is seriously to underestimate the absolute character of the justice of God.

Did Christ Descend Into Hell?</span> It is sometimes argued that Christ descended into hell after he died. The phrase &ldquo;he descended into hell&rdquo; does not occur in the Bible. But the widely used Apostles&rsquo; Creed reads, &ldquo;was crucified, dead, and buried, he descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead.&rdquo; Does this mean that Christ endured further suffering after his death on the cross? As we shall see below, an examination of the biblical evidence indicates that he did not. But before looking at the relevant biblical texts, it is appropriate to examine the phrase &ldquo;he descended into hell&rdquo; in the Apostles&rsquo; Creed.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) The Origin of the Phrase, &ldquo;He Descended Into Hell&rdquo;</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A murky background lies behind much of the history of the phrase itself. Its origins, where they can be found, are far from praiseworthy. The great church historian Philip Schaff has summarized the development of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed in an extensive chart, which is reproduced on pages <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?ref=Page.pp+583-585">583&ndash;85</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This chart shows that, unlike the Nicene Creed and the Chalcedonian Definition, the Apostles&rsquo; Creed was not written or approved by a single church council at one specific time. Rather, it gradually took shape from about <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 200 to 750.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is surprising to find that the phrase &ldquo;he descended into hell&rdquo; was not found in any of the early versions of the Creed (in the versions used in Rome, in the rest of Italy, and in Africa) until it appeared in one of two versions from Rufinus in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 390. Then it was not included again in any version of the Creed until <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 650. Moreover, Rufinus, the only person who included it before <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 650, did not think that it meant that Christ descended into hell, but understood the phrase simply to mean that Christ was &ldquo;buried.&rdquo; In other words, he took it to mean that Christ &ldquo;descended into the grave.&rdquo; (The Greek form has <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ᾅδης</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK87">G87</a>) which can mean just &ldquo;grave,&rdquo; not <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">γέεννα</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1147">G1147</a>) &ldquo;hell, place of punishment.&rdquo;). We should also note that the phrase only appears in one of the two versions of the Creed that we have from Rufinus: it was not in the Roman form of the Creed that he preserved.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 587  </span>This means, therefore, that until <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 650 no version of the Creed included this phrase with the intention of saying that Christ &ldquo;descended into hell&mdash;the only version to include the phrase before <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 650 gives it a different meaning. At this point one wonders if the term <span style="font-style:italic;">apostolic</span> can in any sense be applied to this phrase, or if it really has a rightful place in a creed whose title claims for itself descent from the earliest apostles of Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This survey of the historical development of the phrase also raises the possibility that when the phrase first began to be more commonly used, it may have been in other versions (now lost to us) that did not have the expression &ldquo;and buried.&rdquo; If so, it probably would have meant to others just what it meant to Rufinus: &ldquo;descended into the grave.&rdquo; But later when the phrase was incorporated into different versions of the Creed that already had the phrase &ldquo;and buried,&rdquo; some other explanation had to be given to it. This mistaken insertion of the phrase after the words &ldquo;and buried&rdquo;&mdash;apparently done by someone around <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 650&mdash;led to all sorts of attempts to explain &ldquo;he descended into hell&rdquo; in some way that did not contradict the rest of Scripture.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some have taken it to mean that Christ suffered the pains of hell while on the cross. Calvin, for example, says that &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s descent into hell&rdquo; refers to the fact that he not only died a bodily death but that &ldquo;it was expedient at the same time for him to undergo the severity of God&rsquo;s vengeance, to appease his wrath and satisfy his just judgment.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, the <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HeidelbergCatechism.Q_44">Heidelberg Catechism, Question 44</a>, asks,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Why is it added: He descended into Hades?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Answer: That in my greatest temptations I may be assured that Christ, my Lord, by his inexpressible anguish, pains, and terrors which he suffered in his soul on the cross and before, has redeemed me from the anguish and torment of hell.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But is this a satisfactory explanation of the phrase, &ldquo;he descended into hell&rdquo;? While it is true that Christ suffered the outpouring of God&rsquo;s wrath on the cross, this explanation does not really fit the phrase in the Apostles&rsquo; Creed&mdash;&ldquo;descended&rdquo; hardly represents this idea, and the placement of the phrase after &ldquo;was crucified, dead, and buried&rdquo; makes this an artificial and unconvincing interpretation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Others have understood it to mean that Christ continued in the &ldquo;state of death&rdquo; until his resurrection. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/WestminsterLargerCatechism.Q_50">The Westminster Larger Catechism, Question 50</a>, says,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Christ&rsquo;s humiliation after his death consisted in his being buried, and continuing in the state of the dead, and under the power of death till the third day; which hath been otherwise expressed in these words, He descended into hell.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Though it is true that Christ continued in the state of death until the third day, once again it is a strained and unpersuasive explanation of &ldquo;he descended into hell,&rdquo; for the placement of the phrase would then give the awkward sense, &ldquo;he was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended to being dead.&rdquo; This interpretation does not explain what the words first meant in this sequence but is rather an unconvincing attempt to salvage some theologically acceptable sense out of them.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 588  </span>Moreover, the English word &ldquo;hell&rdquo; has no such sense as simply &ldquo;being dead&rdquo; (though the Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ᾅδης</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK87">G87</a>, can mean this), so this becomes a doubly artificial explanation for English-speaking people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, some have argued that the phrase means just what it appears to mean on first reading: that Christ actually did descend into hell after his death on the cross. It is easy to understand the Apostles&rsquo; Creed to mean just this (indeed, that is certainly the natural sense), but then another question arises: Can this idea be supported from Scripture?

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(2) Possible Biblical Support for a Descent Into Hell</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Support for the idea that Christ descended into hell has been found primarily in five passages: <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.27">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro10.6-7">Romans 10:6&ndash;7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.8-9">Ephesians 4:8&ndash;9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.18-20">1 Peter 3:18&ndash;20</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.6">1 Peter 4:6</a>. (A few other passages have been appealed to, but less convincingly.) On closer inspection, do any of those passages clearly establish this teaching?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">(a) </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.27"><span style="font-style:italic;">Acts 2:27</span></a>. This is part of Peter&rsquo;s sermon on the Day of Pentecost, where he is quoting <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps16.10">Psalm 16:10</a>. In the King James Version the verse reads: &ldquo;because thou wilt not <span style="font-style:italic;">leave my soul in hell</span> neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Does this mean that Christ entered hell after he died? Not necessarily, because another sense is certainly possible for these verses. The word &ldquo;hell&rdquo; here represents a New Testament Greek term (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ᾅδης</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK87">G87</a>) and an Old Testament Hebrew term (<span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew; font-size:15.95pt; direction:rtl;" lang="he">שְׁאֹול</span>&#x200E;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/HebrewGK.HGK8619">H8619</a>, popularly translated as sheol) that can mean simply &ldquo;the grave&rdquo; or &ldquo;death&rdquo; (the state of being dead). Thus, the NIV translates: &ldquo;Because you will not <span style="font-style:italic;">abandon me to the grave</span> nor will you let your Holy One see decay&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.27">Acts 2:27</a>). This sense is preferable because the context emphasizes that Christ&rsquo;s body rose from the grave, unlike David&rsquo;s, which remained in the grave. The reasoning is: &ldquo;My body also will live in hope&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.26">26</a>), &ldquo;because you will not abandon me to the grave&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.27">27</a>). Peter is using David&rsquo;s psalm to show that Christ&rsquo;s body did not decay&mdash;he is therefore unlike David, who &ldquo;died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac2.29">29</a> NIV). Therefore this passage about Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from the grave does not convincingly support the idea that Christ descended into hell.

		<span style="font-style:italic;">(b) </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Ro10.6-7"><span style="font-style:italic;">Romans 10:6&ndash;7</span></a>. These verses contain two rhetorical questions, again Old Testament quotations (from <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt30.13">Deut. 30:13</a>): &ldquo;Do not say in your heart, &ldquo;Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down) or &ldquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).&rdquo; But this passage hardly teaches that Christ descended into hell. The point of the passage is that Paul is telling people not to ask these questions, because Christ is not far away&mdash;he is near&mdash;and faith in him is as near as confessing with our mouth and believing in our heart (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro10.9">9</a>). These prohibited questions are questions of unbelief, not assertions of what Scripture teaches. However, some may object that Paul would not have anticipated that his readers would ask such questions unless it was widely known that Christ did in fact descend &ldquo;into the abyss.&rdquo; However, even if this were true, Scripture would not be saying or implying that Christ went into &ldquo;hell&rdquo; (in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 589  </span>sense of a place of punishment for the dead, ordinarily expressed by Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">γέεννα</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1147">G1147</a>), but rather that he went into &ldquo;the abyss&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἄβυσσος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK12">G12</a>) a term which often in the LXX is used of the depths of the ocean [<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge1.2">Gen. 1:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge7.11">7:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ge8.2">8:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt8.7">Deut. 8:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps107.26">Ps. 106:26</a> (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps107.26">107:26</a>)], but it can also apparently refer just to the realm of the dead [<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps71.20">Ps. 70:20</a> (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps71.20">71:20</a>)]).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul here uses the word &ldquo;deep&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἄβυσσος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK12">G12</a>)) as a contrast to &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; in order to give the sense of a place that is unreachable, inaccessible to human beings. The contrast is not, &ldquo;Who shall go to find Christ in a place of great blessing (heaven) or a place of great punishment (hell)?&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;Who shall go to find Christ in a place that is inaccessibly high (heaven) or in a place that is inaccessibly low (the deep, or the realm of death)?&rdquo; No clear affirmation or denial of a &ldquo;descent into hell&rdquo; can be found in this passage.

		<span style="font-style:italic;">(c) </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.8-9"><span style="font-style:italic;">Ephesians 4:8&ndash;9</span></a>. Here Paul writes, &ldquo;In saying, &ldquo;He ascended,&rsquo; what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Does this mean that Christ &ldquo;descended&rdquo; to hell? It is at first unclear what is meant by &ldquo;the lower parts of the earth,&rdquo; but another translation seems to give the best sense: &ldquo;What does &ldquo;he ascended&rsquo; mean except that he also descended to the <span style="font-style:italic;">lower, earthly regions?</span>&rdquo; (NIV). Here the NIV takes &ldquo;descended&rdquo; to refer to Christ&rsquo;s coming to earth as a baby (the Incarnation). The last four words are an acceptable understanding of the Greek text, taking the phrase &ldquo;the lower regions <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> the earth&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;lower regions <span style="font-style:italic;">which are</span> the earth&rdquo; (the grammatical form in Greek would then be called a genitive of apposition). We do the same thing in English&mdash;for example, in the phrase &ldquo;the city of Chicago,&rdquo; we mean &ldquo;the city which is Chicago.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The NIV rendering is preferable in this context because Paul is saying that the Christ who went up to heaven (in his ascension) is the same one who earlier came down from heaven (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph4.10">10</a>). That &ldquo;descent&rdquo; from heaven occurred, of course, when Christ came to be born as a man. So the verse speaks of the incarnation, not of a descent into hell.

		<span style="font-style:italic;">(d) </span><a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.18-20"><span style="font-style:italic;">1 Peter 3:18&ndash;20</span></a>. For many people this is the most puzzling passage on this entire subject. Peter tells us that Christ was &ldquo;put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit; <span style="font-style:italic;">in which he went and preached to the spirits in prison</span> who formerly did not obey, when God&rsquo;s patience waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark&rdquo; (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">rsv</span>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">Does this refer to Christ preaching in hell?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some have taken &ldquo;he went and preached to the spirits in prison&rdquo; to mean that Christ went into hell and preached to the spirits who were there&mdash;either <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 590  </span>proclaiming the gospel and offering a second chance to repent, or just proclaiming that he had triumphed over them and that they were eternally condemned.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But these interpretations fail to explain adequately either the passage itself or its setting in this context. Peter does not say that Christ preached to spirits generally, but only to those &ldquo;who formerly did not obey … <span style="font-style:italic;">during the building of the ark.</span>&rdquo; Such a limited audience&mdash;those who disobeyed during the building of the ark&mdash;would be a strange group for Christ to travel to hell and preach to. If Christ proclaimed his triumph, why only to these sinners and not to all? And if he offered a second chance for salvation, why only to these sinners and not to all? Even more difficult for this view is the fact that Scripture elsewhere indicates that there is no opportunity for repentance after death (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.26">Luke 16:26</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.26-27">Heb. 10:26&ndash;27</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, the context of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3">1 Peter 3</a> makes &ldquo;preaching in hell&rdquo; unlikely. Peter is encouraging his readers to witness boldly to hostile unbelievers around them. He just told them to &ldquo;always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.15">1 Peter 3:15</a> NIV). This evangelistic motif would lose its urgency if Peter were teaching a second chance for salvation after death. And it would not fit at all with a &ldquo;preaching&rdquo; of condemnation.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">Does it refer to Christ preaching to fallen angels?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		To give a better explanation for these difficulties, several commentators have proposed taking &ldquo;spirits in prison&rdquo; to mean demonic spirits, the spirits of fallen angels, and have said that Christ proclaimed condemnation to these demons. This (it is claimed) would comfort Peter&rsquo;s readers by showing them that the demonic forces oppressing them would also be defeated by Christ.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		However, Peter&rsquo;s readers would have to go through an incredibly complicated reasoning process to draw this conclusion when Peter does not explicitly teach it. They would have to reason from (1) some demons who sinned long ago were condemned, to (2) other demons are now inciting your human persecutors, to (3) those demons will likewise be condemned someday, to (4) therefore your persecutors will finally be judged as well. Finally Peter&rsquo;s readers would get to Peter&rsquo;s point: (5) Therefore don&rsquo;t fear your persecutors.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Those who hold this &ldquo;preaching to fallen angels&rdquo; view must assume that Peter&rsquo;s readers would &ldquo;read between the lines&rdquo; and conclude all this (points <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/grudemest?pos=P...590%3aNUM2">2&ndash;5</a>) from the simple statement that Christ &ldquo;preached to the spirits in prison, who formerly did not obey&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.19-20">1 Peter 3:19&ndash;20</a>). But does it not seem too farfetched to say that Peter knew his readers would read all this into the text?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, Peter emphasizes hostile <span style="font-style:italic;">persons</span> not demons, in the context (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.14">1 Peter 3:14</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.16">16</a>). And where would Peter&rsquo;s readers get the idea that angels sinned &ldquo;during the building of the ark&rdquo;? There is nothing of that in the Genesis story about the building of the ark. And (in spite of what some have claimed), if we look at all the traditions of Jewish interpretation of the flood story, we find no mention of angels sinning specifically &ldquo;during the building of the ark.&rdquo; Therefore the view that Peter is speaking of Christ&rsquo;s proclamation of judgment to fallen angels is really not persuasive either.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 591  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Does it refer to Christ&rsquo;s Proclaiming release to Old Testament saints?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another explanation is that Christ, after his death, went and proclaimed release to Old Testament believers who had been unable to enter heaven until the completion of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But again we may question whether this view adequately accounts for what the text actually says. It does not say that Christ preached to those who were believers or faithful to God, but to those &ldquo;who formerly <span style="font-style:italic;">did not obey</span>&mdash;the emphasis is on their disobedience. Moreover, Peter does not specify Old Testament believers generally, but only those who were disobedient &ldquo;in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.20">1 Peter 3:20</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, Scripture gives us no clear evidence to make us think that full access to the blessings of being in God&rsquo;s presence in heaven were withheld from Old Testament believers when they died&mdash;indeed, several passages suggest that believers who died before Christ&rsquo;s death did enter into the presence of God at once because their sins were forgiven by trusting in the Messiah who was to come (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ge5.24">Gen. 5:24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Sa12.23">2 Sam. 12:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps16.11">Pss. 16:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps17.15">17:15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps23.6">23:6</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ec12.7">Eccl. 12:7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt22.31-32">Matt. 22:31&ndash;32</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.22">Luke 16:22</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro4.1-8">Rom. 4:1&ndash;8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb11.5">Heb. 11:5</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A more satisfying explanation.</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The most satisfactory explanation of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.19-20">1 Peter 3:19&ndash;20</a> seems rather to be one proposed (but not really defended) long ago by Augustine: the passage refers not to something Christ did between his death and resurrection, but to what he did &ldquo;in the spiritual realm of existence&rdquo; (or &ldquo;through the Spirit&rdquo;) <span style="font-style:italic;">at the time of Noah</span>. When Noah was building the ark, Christ &ldquo;in spirit&rdquo; was preaching through Noah to the hostile unbelievers around him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This view gains support from two other statements of Peter. In <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.11">1 Peter 1:11</a>, he says that the &ldquo;Spirit of Christ&rdquo; was speaking in the Old Testament prophets. This suggests that Peter could readily have thought that the &ldquo;Spirit of Christ&rdquo; was speaking through Noah as well. Then in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.5">2 Peter 2:5</a>, he calls Noah a &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">preacher</span> of righteousness&rdquo; (NIV), using the noun (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">κῆρυξ</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3061">G3061</a>) that comes from the same root as the verb &ldquo;preached&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐκήρυξεν</span>, from <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">κηρύσσω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3062">G3062</a>) in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.19">1 Peter 3:19</a>. So it seems likely that when Christ &ldquo;preached to the spirits in prison&rdquo; he did so through Noah in the days before the flood.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The people to whom Christ preached through Noah were unbelievers on the earth at the time of Noah, but Peter calls them &ldquo;spirits in prison&rdquo; because they are now in the prison of hell&mdash;even though they were not just &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; but persons on earth when the preaching was done. (The NASB says Christ preached &ldquo;to the spirits now in prison.&rdquo;) We can speak the same way in English: &ldquo;I knew President Clinton when he was a college student&rdquo; is an appropriate statement, even though he was not president when he was in college. The sentence means, &ldquo;I knew the man who is now President Clinton when he was still a student in college.&rdquo; So &ldquo;Christ preached to the spirits in prison&rdquo; means &ldquo;Christ preached to people who are now spirits in prison when they were still persons on earth.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This interpretation is very appropriate to the larger context of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.13-22">1 Peter 3:13&ndash;</a><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 592  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.13-22">22</a>.

		Such an understanding of the text seems to be by far the most likely solution to a puzzling passage. Yet this means that our fourth possible support for a descent of Christ into hell also turns up negative&mdash;the text speaks rather of something Christ did on earth at the time of Noah.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Does this verse mean that Christ went to hell and preached the gospel to those who had died? If so, it would be the only passage in the Bible that taught a &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; for salvation after death and would contradict passages such as <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.19-31">Luke 16:19&ndash;31</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.27">Hebrews 9:27</a>, which clearly seem to deny this possibility. Moreover, the passage does not explicitly say that Christ preached to people after they had died, and could rather mean that the gospel in general was preached (this verse does not even say that Christ preached) to people who are now dead, but that it was preached to them while they were still alive on earth.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is a common explanation, and it seems to fit this verse much better. It finds support in the second word of the verse, &ldquo;this,&rdquo; which refers back to the final judgment mentioned at the end of verse <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.5">5</a>. Peter is saying that it was because of the final judgment that the gospel was preached to the dead.
	</p>

		This would comfort the readers concerning their Christian friends who had already died. They may have wondered, &ldquo;Did the gospel benefit them, since it didn&rsquo;t save them from death?&rdquo; Peter answers that the reason the gospel was preached to those who had died was not to save them from physical death (they were &ldquo;judged in the flesh like men&rdquo;) but to save them from final judgment (they will &ldquo;live in the spirit like God&rdquo;). Therefore, the fact that they had died did not indicate that the gospel had failed in its purpose&mdash;for they would surely live forever in the spiritual realm.

		Thus, &ldquo;the dead&rdquo; are people who have died and are now dead, even though they were alive and on earth when the gospel was preached to them. (The NIV translates, &ldquo;For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to <span style="font-style:italic;">those who are now dead,</span>&rdquo; and NASB has &ldquo;those who are dead.&rdquo;) This avoids the doctrinal problem of a &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; of salvation after death and fits both the wording and the context of the verse.

		At this point, people on all sides of the question of whether Christ actually descended into hell should be able to agree at least that the idea of Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;descent into hell&rdquo; is not taught clearly or explicitly in any passage of Scripture. And many people (including the present author) will conclude that this idea is not taught in Scripture at all. But beyond the question of whether any passage positively teaches this idea, we must ask whether it is contrary to any passages of Scripture.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition to the fact that there is little if any biblical support for a descent of Christ into hell, there are some New Testament texts that argue against the possibility of Christ&rsquo;s going to hell after his death.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus&rsquo; words to the thief on the cross, &ldquo;Today you will be with me in Paradise&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.43">Luke 23:43</a>), imply that after Jesus died his soul (or spirit) went immediately to the presence of the Father in heaven, even though his body remained on earth and was buried. Some people deny this by arguing that &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; is a place distinct from heaven, but in both of the other New Testament uses the word clearly means &ldquo;heaven&rdquo;: in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co12.4">2 Corinthians 12:4</a> it is the place to which Paul was caught up in his revelation of heaven, and in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re2.7">Revelation 2:7</a> it is the place where we find the tree of life&mdash;which is clearly heaven in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.2">Revelation 22:2</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.14">14</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition, the cry of Jesus, &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn19.30">John 19:30</a>) strongly suggests that Christ&rsquo;s suffering was finished at that moment and so was his alienation from the Father because of bearing our sin. This implies that he would not descend into hell, but would go at once into the Father&rsquo;s presence.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, the cry, &ldquo;Father, into your hands I commit my spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.46">Luke 23:46</a>), also suggests that Christ expected (correctly) the immediate end of his suffering and estrangement and the welcoming of his spirit into heaven by God the Father (note Stephen&rsquo;s similar cry in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.59">Acts 7:59</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		These texts indicate, then, that Christ in his death experienced the same things believers in this present age experience when they die: his dead body remained on earth and was buried (as ours will be), but his spirit (or soul) passed immediately into the presence of God in heaven (just as ours will). Then on the first Easter morning, Christ&rsquo;s spirit was reunited with his body and he was raised from the dead&mdash;just as Christians who have died will (when Christ returns) be reunited to their bodies and raised in their perfect resurrection bodies to new life.

This is much greater comfort regarding death than could ever be given by any view of a descent into hell.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">(4) Conclusion Regarding the Apostles&rsquo; Creed and the Question of Christ&rsquo;s Possible Descent Into Hell</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Does the phrase &ldquo;he descended into hell&rdquo; deserve to be retained in the Apostles&rsquo; Creed alongside the great doctrines of the faith on which all can agree? The single argument in its favor seems to be the fact that it has been around so long. But an old mistake is still a mistake&mdash;and as long as it has been around there has been confusion and disagreement over its meaning.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other side, there are several compelling reasons against keeping the phrase. It has no clear warrant from Scripture and indeed seems to be contradicted by some passages in Scripture. It has no claim to being &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo; and no support (in the sense of a &ldquo;descent into hell&rdquo;) from the first six centuries of the church. It was not in the earliest versions of the Creed and was only included in it later because of an apparent misunderstanding about its meaning. Unlike every other phrase in the Creed, it represents not some major doctrine on which all Christians agree, but rather a statement about which most Christians seem to disagree. It is at best confusing and in most cases misleading for modern Christians. My own judgment is that there would be all gain and no loss if it were dropped from the Creed once for all.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Concerning the doctrinal question of whether Christ did descend into hell after he died, the answer from several passages of Scripture seems clearly to be no.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. The Extent of the Atonement</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One of the differences between Reformed theologians and other Catholic and Protestant theologians has been the question of the extent of the atonement. The question may be put this way: when Christ died on the cross, did he pay for the sins of the entire human race or only for the sins of those who he knew would ultimately be saved?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Non-Reformed people argue that the gospel offer in Scripture is repeatedly made to all people, and for this offer to be genuine, the payment for sins must have already been made and must be actually available for all people. They also say that if the people whose sins Christ paid for are limited, then the free offer of the gospel also is limited, and the offer of the gospel cannot be made to all mankind without exception.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, Reformed people argue that if Christ&rsquo;s death actually paid for the sins of every person who ever lived, then there is no penalty left for <span style="font-style:italic;">anyone</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 595  </span>to pay, and it necessarily follows that all people will be saved, without exception. For God could not condemn to eternal punishment anyone whose sins are already paid for: that would be demanding double payment, and it would therefore be unjust. In answer to the objection that this compromises the free offer of the gospel to every person, Reformed people answer that we do not know who they are who will come to trust in Christ, for only God knows that. As far as we are concerned, the free offer of the gospel is to be made to everybody without exception. We also know that everyone who repents and believes in Christ will be saved, so all are called to repentance (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.30">Acts 17:30</a>). The fact that God foreknew who would be saved, and that he accepted Christ&rsquo;s death as payment for their sins only, does not inhibit the free offer of the gospel, for who will respond to it is hidden in the secret counsels of God. That we do not know who will respond no more constitutes a reason for not offering the gospel to all than not knowing the extent of the harvest prevents the farmer from sowing seed in his fields.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, Reformed people argue that God&rsquo;s purposes in redemption are agreed upon within the Trinity and they are certainly accomplished. Those whom God planned to save are the same people for whom Christ also came to die, and to those same people the Holy Spirit will certainly apply the benefits of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work, even awakening their faith (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.12">John 1:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.29">Phil. 1:29</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.2">Eph. 2:2</a>) and calling them to trust in him. What God the Father purposed, God the Son and the Holy Spirit agreed to and surely carried out.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Scripture Passages Used to Support the Reformed View</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Several Scripture passages speak of the fact that Christ died for his people. &ldquo;The good shepherd lays down his life <span style="font-style:italic;">for the sheep</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.11">John 10:11</a>). &ldquo;I lay down my life for the sheep&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.15">John 10:15</a>). Paul speaks of &ldquo;the church of God which he obtained with the blood of his own Son&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac20.28">Acts 20:28</a>). He also says, &ldquo;He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, will he not also give us all things with him?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.32">Rom. 8:32</a>). This passage indicates a connection between God&rsquo;s purpose in giving up his Son &ldquo;for us all&rdquo; and giving us &ldquo;all things&rdquo; that pertain to salvation as well. In the next sentence Paul clearly limits the application of this to those who will be saved because he says, &ldquo;Who shall bring any charge against God&rsquo;s elect?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.33">Rom. 8:33</a>) and in the next verse mentions Christ&rsquo;s death as a reason why no one shall bring a charge against the elect (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.34">8:34</a>). In another passage, Paul says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up <span style="font-style:italic;">for her</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.25">Eph. 5:25</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Moreover, Christ during his earthly ministry is aware of a group of people whom the Father has given to him. &ldquo;All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out … this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.37-39">John 6:37&ndash;39</a>). He also says, &ldquo;I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.9">John 17:9</a>). He then goes on from this specific reference to the disciples to say, &ldquo;I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn17.20">John 17:20</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, some passages speak of a definite transaction between the Father and the Son when Christ died, a transaction that had specific reference to those who would believe. For example, Paul says, &ldquo;God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died <span style="font-style:italic;">for us</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.8">Rom. 5:8</a>). He adds, &ldquo;For if while we were <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 596  </span>enemies <span style="font-style:italic;">we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son</span> much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.10">Rom. 5:10</a>). This reconciliation to God occurred with respect to the specific people who would be saved, and it occurred &ldquo;while we were enemies.&rdquo; Similarly, Paul says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">For our sake</span> he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.21">2 Cor. 5:21</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ga1.4">Gal. 1:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.7">Eph. 1:7</a>). And &ldquo;Christ redeemed <span style="font-style:italic;">us</span> from the curse of the law, having become a curse <span style="font-style:italic;">for us</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga3.13">Gal. 3:13</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Further support for the Reformed view is found in the consideration that all the blessings of salvation, including faith, repentance, and all of the works of the Holy Spirit in applying redemption, were also secured by Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work specifically for his people. Those for whom he earned forgiveness also have had those other benefits earned for them (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.3-4">Eph. 1:3&ndash;4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph2.8">2:8</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.29">Phil. 1:29</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What I have called &ldquo;the Reformed view&rdquo; in this section is commonly referred to as &ldquo;limited atonement.&rdquo; However, most theologians who hold this position today do not prefer the term &ldquo;limited atonement&rdquo; because it is so easily subject to misunderstanding, as if this view somehow held that Christ&rsquo;s atoning work was deficient in some way. The term that is usually preferred is <span style="font-style:italic;">particular redemption</span> since this view holds that Christ died for particular people (specifically, those who would be saved and whom he came to redeem), that he foreknew each one of them individually (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.3-5">Eph. 1:3&ndash;5</a>) and had them individually in mind in his atoning work.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The opposite position, that Christ&rsquo;s death actually paid for the sins of all people who ever lived, is called &ldquo;general redemption&rdquo; or &ldquo;unlimited atonement.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Scripture Passages Used to Support the Non-Reformed View (General Redemption or Unlimited Atonement)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> A number of Scripture passages indicate that in some sense Christ died for the whole world. John the Baptist said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin <span style="font-style:italic;">of the world!</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.29">John 1:29</a>). And <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.16">John 3:16</a> tells us that &ldquo;God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;The <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 597  </span>bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.51">John 6:51</a>). Paul says that in Christ &ldquo;God was reconciling <span style="font-style:italic;">the world</span> to himself&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.19">2 Cor. 5:19</a>). We read of Christ that &ldquo;he is the expiation [lit. &ldquo;propitiation&rsquo;] for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of <span style="font-style:italic;">the whole world</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.2">1 John 2:2</a>). Paul writes that Christ Jesus &ldquo;gave himself as a ransom <span style="font-style:italic;">for all</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.6">1 Tim. 2:6</a>). And the author of Hebrews says that Jesus was for a little while made lower than the angels &ldquo;so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.9">Heb. 2:9</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Other passages appear to speak of Christ dying for those who will not be saved. Paul says, &ldquo;Do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro14.15">Rom. 14:15</a>). In a similar context he tells the Corinthians not to eat publicly at an idol&rsquo;s temple because they might encourage those who are weak in their faith to violate their consciences and eat food offered to idols. He then says, &ldquo;And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother <span style="font-style:italic;">for whom Christ died</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.11">1 Cor. 8:11</a>). Peter writes about false teachers as follows: &ldquo;But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, <span style="font-style:italic;">even denying the Master who bought them</span> bringing upon themselves swift destruction&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.1">2 Peter 2:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.29">Heb. 10:29</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Some Points of Agreement and Some Conclusions About Disputed Texts</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> It would be helpful first to list the points on which both sides agree:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		1. Not all will be saved.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		2. A free offer of the gospel can rightly be made to every person ever born. It is completely true that &ldquo;whoever will&rdquo; may come to Christ for salvation, and no one who comes to him will be turned away. This free offer of the gospel is extended in good faith to every person.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		3. All agree that Christ&rsquo;s death in itself, because he is the infinite Son of God, has infinite merit and is in itself sufficient to pay the penalty of the sins of as many or as few as the Father and the Son decreed. The question is not about the intrinsic merits of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings and death, but about the number of people for whom the Father and the Son thought Christ&rsquo;s death to be sufficient payment at the time Christ died.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Beyond these points of agreement, however, a difference remains concerning the following question: &ldquo;When Christ died, did he <span style="font-style:italic;">actually pay the penalty</span> only for the sins of those who would believe in him, or for the sins of every person who ever lived?&rdquo; On this question it seems that those who hold to particular redemption have stronger arguments on their side. First, an important point that is not generally answered by advocates of the general redemption view is that people who are eternally condemned to hell suffer the penalty for all of their own sins, and therefore their penalty could not have been fully taken by Christ. Those who hold the general redemption view sometimes answer that people suffer in hell because of the sin of rejecting Christ, even though their other sins were paid for. But this is hardly a satisfactory position, for (1) some have never rejected Christ because they have never heard of him, and (2) the emphasis of Scripture when it speaks of eternal punishment is not on the fact that the people suffer because they have rejected Christ, but on the fact that they suffer because of their own sins in this life (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.6-8">Rom. 5:6&ndash;8</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro5.13-16">13&ndash;16</a>, et al.). This significant point seems to tip the argument decisively in favor of the particular redemption position.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 598  </span>Another significant point in favor of particular redemption is the fact that Christ completely earned our salvation, paying the penalty for all our sins. He did not just redeem us potentially, but actually redeemed us as individuals whom he loved. A third weighty point in favor of particular redemption is that there is eternal unity in the counsels and plans of God and in the work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in accomplishing their plans (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.28-30">Rom. 8:28&ndash;30</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With regard to Scripture passages used to support general redemption, the following may be said: Several passages that speak about &ldquo;the world&rdquo; simply mean that sinners generally will be saved, without implying that every single individual in the world will be saved. So the fact that Christ is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn1.29">John 1:29</a>) does not mean (on anybody&rsquo;s interpretation) that Christ actually removes the sins of every single person in the world, for both sides agree that not all are saved. Similarly, the fact that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.19">2 Cor. 5:19</a>) does not mean that every single person in the world was reconciled to God, but that sinners generally were reconciled to God. Another way of putting these two passages would be to say that Jesus was the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of sinners, or that God was in Christ reconciling sinners to himself. This does not mean that all sinners will be saved or were reconciled, but simply that these groups in general, but not necessarily every single person in them, were the objects of God&rsquo;s redeeming work: it essentially means that &ldquo;God so loved sinners that he gave his only Son …&rdquo; without implying that every sinner in the whole world will be saved.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The passages that speak about Christ dying &ldquo;for&rdquo; the whole world are best understood to refer to the free offer of the gospel that is made to all people. When Jesus says, &ldquo;The bread which I shall give <span style="font-style:italic;">for the life of the world</span> is my flesh&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.51">John 6:51</a>), it is in the context of speaking of himself as the Bread that came down from heaven, which is offered to people and which they may, if they are willing, receive for themselves. Earlier in the same discussion Jesus said that &ldquo;the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.33">John 6:33</a>). This may be understood in the sense of bringing redeeming life into the world but not meaning that every single person in the world will have that redeeming life. Jesus then speaks of himself as inviting others to come and take up this living bread: &ldquo;He who comes to me shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst … This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.35">John 6:35</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.50-51">50&ndash;51</a>). Jesus gives his flesh to bring life into the world and to offer life to the world, but to say that Jesus came to offer eternal life to the world (a point on which both sides agree) is not to say that he actually paid the penalty for the sins of everyone who would ever live, for that is a separate question.

		When John says that Christ &ldquo;is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.2">1 John 2:2</a>, author&rsquo;s translation), he may simply be understood to mean that Christ is the atoning sacrifice that the gospel now <span style="font-style:italic;">makes available for</span> the sins of everyone in the world. The preposition &ldquo;for&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">περί</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4309">G4309</a>, plus genitive) is ambiguous with respect to the specific sense in which Christ is the propitiation &ldquo;for&rdquo; the sins of the world. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">Περί</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4309">G4309</a>) simply means &ldquo;concerning&rdquo; or &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo; but is not specific enough to define the exact <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 599  </span>way in which Christ is the sacrifice with respect to the sins of the world. It would be entirely consistent with the language of the verse to think that John is simply saying that Christ is the atoning sacrifice who is available to pay for the sins of anyone in the world. Likewise, when Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave himself as a ransom <span style="font-style:italic;">for all</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.6">1 Tim. 2:6</a>), we are to understand this to mean a ransom available for all people, without exception.

		When the author of Hebrews says that Christ was made lower than the angels &ldquo;so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.9">Heb. 2:9</a>), the passage is best understood to refer to every one of Christ&rsquo;s people, every one who is redeemed. It does not say everyone &ldquo;in the whole world&rdquo; or any such expression, and in the immediate context the author is certainly speaking of those who are redeemed (see &ldquo;bringing many sons to glory&rdquo; [v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.10">10</a>]; &ldquo;those who are sanctified&rdquo; [v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.11">11</a>]; and &ldquo;the children God has given me&rdquo; [v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.13">13</a>]). The Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">πᾶς</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4246">G4246</a>) here translated &ldquo;every one,&rdquo; is also used in a similar sense to mean &ldquo;all of God&rsquo;s people&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb8.11">Hebrews 8:11</a>, &ldquo;for <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> shall know me,&rdquo; and in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.8">Hebrews 12:8</a>, &ldquo;If you are left without discipline, in which <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.&rdquo; In both cases the &ldquo;all&rdquo; is not explicitly restricted by a specific phrase such as &ldquo;all of God&rsquo;s people,&rdquo; but this is clearly the sense in the overall context. Of course, in other contexts, the same word &ldquo;all&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;all people without exception,&rdquo; but this must be determined from the individual context in each case.

		When Paul speaks in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro14.15">Romans 14:15</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.11">1 Corinthians 8:11</a> about the possibility of destroying one for whom Christ died, it seems best here as well to think of the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in the sense that Christ died &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">to make salvation available for</span>&rdquo; these people or &ldquo;to bring the free offer of the gospel to&rdquo; these people who are associated with the fellowship of the church. He does not seem to have in mind the specific question of the inter-trinitarian decision regarding whose sins the Father counted Christ&rsquo;s death as a payment for. Rather, he is speaking of those to whom the gospel has been offered. In another passage, when Paul calls the weak man a &ldquo;brother for whom Christ died&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co8.11">1 Corinthians 8:11</a>, he is not necessarily pronouncing on the inward spiritual condition of a person&rsquo;s heart, but is probably just speaking according to what is often called the &ldquo;judgment of charity&rdquo; by which people who are participating in the fellowship of the church can rightly be referred to as brothers and sisters.

		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 600  </span>When Peter speaks of false teachers who bring in destructive heresies, &ldquo;even denying the Master who bought them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.1">2 Peter 2:1</a>), it is unclear whether the word &ldquo;Master&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">δεσπότης</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1305">G1305</a>) refers to Christ (as in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud4">Jude 4</a>) or to God the Father (as in <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk2.29">Luke 2:29</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac4.24">Acts 4:24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.10">Rev. 6:10</a>). In either case, the Old Testament allusion is probably to <a href="https://ref.ly/Dt32.6">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, where Moses says to the rebellious people who have turned away from God, &ldquo;Is not he your Father <span style="font-style:italic;">who has bought you?</span>&rdquo; (author&rsquo;s translation). Peter is drawing an analogy between the past false prophets who arose among the Jews and those who will be false teachers within the churches to which he writes: &ldquo;But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.1">2 Peter 2:1</a>). In line with this clear reference to false prophets in the Old Testament, Peter also alludes to the fact that the rebellious Jews turned away from God who &ldquo;bought&rdquo; them out of Egypt in the exodus. From the time of the exodus onward, any Jewish person would have considered himself or herself one who was &ldquo;bought&rdquo; by God in the exodus and therefore a person of God&rsquo;s own possession. In this sense, the false teachers arising among the people were denying God their Father, to whom they rightfully belonged. So the text means not that Christ had redeemed these false prophets, but simply that they were rebellious Jewish people (or church attenders in the same position as the rebellious Jews) who were rightly owned by God because they had been brought out of the land of Egypt (or their forefathers had), but they were ungrateful to him. Christ&rsquo;s specific redemptive work on the cross is not in view in this verse.

		With regard to the verses that talk of Christ&rsquo;s dying for his sheep, his church, or his people, non-Reformed people may answer that these passages do not deny that he died to pay the penalty for others as well. In response, while it is true that they do not explicitly deny that Christ died for others as well, their frequent reference to his death for his people would at least strongly suggest that this is a correct inference. Even if they do not absolutely imply such a particularizing of redemption, these verses do at least seem to be most naturally interpreted in this way.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In conclusion, it seems to me that the Reformed position of &ldquo;particular redemption&rdquo; is most consistent with the overall teaching of Scripture. But once that has been said, several points of caution need to be raised.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 601  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Points of Clarification and Caution Regarding This Doctrine</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> It is important to state some points of clarification and also some areas in which we can rightly object to the way in which some advocates of particular redemption have expressed their arguments. It is also important to ask what the pastoral implications are for this teaching.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		1. It seems to be a mistake to state the question as Berkhof does and focus on the purpose of the Father and the Son, rather than on what actually happened in the atonement. If we confine the discussion to the purpose of the atonement, then this is just another form of the larger dispute between Calvinists and Arminians over whether God&rsquo;s purpose is (a) to save all people, a purpose that is frustrated by man&rsquo;s will to rebel&mdash;the Arminian position&mdash;or whether God&rsquo;s purpose is (b) to save those whom he has chosen&mdash;the Calvinist position. This question will not be decided at the narrow point of the question of the extent of the atonement, for the specific scriptural texts on that point are too few and can hardly be said to be conclusive on either side. One&rsquo;s decisions on these passages will tend to be determined by one&rsquo;s view of the larger question as to what Scripture as a whole teaches about the nature of the atonement and about the broader issues of God&rsquo;s providence, sovereignty, and the doctrine of election. Whatever decisions are made on those larger topics will apply specifically to this point, and people will come to their conclusions accordingly.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Rather than focusing on the purpose of the atonement, therefore, the question is rightfully asked about the atonement itself: Did Christ pay for the sins of all unbelievers who will be eternally condemned, and did he pay for their sins fully and completely on the cross? It seems that we have to answer no to that question.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		2. The statements &ldquo;Christ died for his people only&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ died for all people&rdquo; are both true in some senses, and too often the argument over this issue has been confused because of various senses that can be given to the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in these two statements.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The statement &ldquo;Christ died for his people only&rdquo; can be understood to mean that &ldquo;Christ died to actually pay the penalty for all the sins of his people only.&rdquo; In that sense it is true. But when non-Reformed people hear the sentence &ldquo;Christ died for his people only,&rdquo; they often hear in it, &ldquo;Christ died so that he could make the gospel available only to a chosen few,&rdquo; and they are troubled over what they see as a real threat to the free offer of the gospel to every person. Reformed people who hold to particular redemption should recognize the potential for misunderstanding that arises with the sentence &ldquo;Christ died for his people only,&rdquo; and, out of concern for the truth and out of pastoral concern to affirm the free offer of the gospel and to avoid misunderstanding in the body of Christ, they should be more precise in saying exactly what they mean. The simple sentence, &ldquo;Christ died for his people only,&rdquo; while true in the sense explained above, is seldom understood in that way when people unfamiliar with Reformed doctrine hear it, and it therefore is better not to use such an ambiguous sentence at all.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, the sentence, &ldquo;Christ died for all people,&rdquo; is true if it means, &ldquo;Christ died to make salvation available to all people&rdquo; or if it means, &ldquo;Christ died <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 602  </span>to bring the free offer of the gospel to all people.&rdquo; In fact, this is the kind of language Scripture itself uses in passages like <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.51">John 6:51</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Ti2.6">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.2">1 John 2:2</a>. It really seems to be only nit-picking that creates controversies and useless disputes when Reformed people insist on being such purists in their speech that they object any time someone says that &ldquo;Christ died for all people.&rdquo; There are certainly acceptable ways of understanding that sentence that are consistent with the speech of the scriptural authors themselves.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, I do not think we should rush to criticize an evangelist who tells an audience of unbelievers, &ldquo;Christ died for your sins,&rdquo; if it is made clear in the context that it is necessary to trust in Christ before one can receive the benefits of the gospel offer. In that sense the sentence is simply understood to mean &ldquo;Christ died to offer you forgiveness for your sins&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christ died to make available forgiveness for your sins.&rdquo; The important point here is that sinners realize that salvation is available for everyone and that payment of sins is available for everyone.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At this point some Reformed theologians will object and will warn us that if we say to unbelievers, &ldquo;Christ died for your sins,&rdquo; the unbelievers will draw the conclusion, &ldquo;Therefore I am saved no matter what I do.&rdquo; But this does not seem to be a problem in actual fact, for whenever evangelicals (Reformed or non-Reformed) speak about the gospel to unbelievers, they are always very clear on the fact that the death of Christ has no benefit for a person unless that person believes in Christ. Therefore, the problem seems to be more something that Reformed people <span style="font-style:italic;">think</span> unbelievers should believe (if they were consistent in reasoning back into the secret counsels of God and the relationship between the Father and Son in the counsels of the Trinity at the point of Christ&rsquo;s propitiatory sacrifice on the cross). But unbelievers simply do not reason that way: they know that they must exercise faith in Christ before they will experience any benefits from his saving work. Moreover, it is far more likely that people will understand the sentence &ldquo;Christ died for your sins&rdquo; in the doctrinally correct sense that &ldquo;Christ died in order to offer you forgiveness for your sins&rdquo; rather than in the doctrinally incorrect sense, &ldquo;Christ died and completely paid the penalty already for all your sins.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		3. In terms of the practical, pastoral effects of our words, both those who hold to particular redemption and those who hold to general redemption agree at several key points:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		a. Both sincerely want to avoid implying that people will be saved whether they believe in Christ or not. Non-Reformed people sometimes accuse Reformed people of saying that the elect will be saved irrespective of responding to the gospel, but this is clearly a misrepresentation of the Reformed position. On the other hand, Reformed people think that those who hold to general redemption are in danger of implying that everybody will be saved whether they believe in Christ or not. But this is not a position that non-Reformed people actually hold, and it is always precarious to criticize people for a position that they do not say <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 603  </span>they hold, just because you think that they should hold that position if they were consistent with their other views.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		b. Both sides want to avoid implying that there might be some people who come to Christ for salvation but are turned away because Christ did not die for them. No one wants to say or imply to an unbeliever, &ldquo;Christ might have died for your sins (and then again he might not have!).&rdquo; Both sides want to clearly affirm that all who come to Christ for salvation will in fact be saved. &ldquo;Him who comes to me I will not cast out&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.37">John 6:37</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		c. Both sides want to avoid implying that God is hypocritical or insincere when he makes the free offer of the gospel. It is a genuine offer, and it is always true that all who wish to come to Christ for salvation and who do actually come to him will be saved.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		d. Finally, we may ask why this matter is so important after all. Although Reformed people have sometimes made belief in particular redemption a test of doctrinal orthodoxy, it would be healthy to realize that Scripture itself never singles this out as a doctrine of major importance, nor does it once make it the subject of any explicit theological discussion. Our knowledge of the issue comes only from incidental references to it in passages whose concern is with other doctrinal or practical matters. In fact, this is really a question that probes into the inner counsels of the Trinity and does so in an area in which there is very little direct scriptural testimony&mdash;a fact that should cause us to be cautious. A balanced pastoral perspective would seem to be to say that this teaching of particular redemption <span style="font-style:italic;">seems</span> to us to be true, that it gives logical consistency to our theological system, and that it can be helpful in assuring people of Christ&rsquo;s love for them individually and of the completeness of his redemptive work for them; but that it also is a subject that almost inevitably leads to some confusion, some misunderstanding, and often some wrongful argumentativeness and divisiveness among God&rsquo;s people&mdash;all of which are negative pastoral considerations. Perhaps that is why the apostles such as John and Peter and Paul, in their wisdom, placed almost no emphasis on this question at all. And perhaps we would do well to ponder their example.

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Our previous discussion has dealt with many aspects of the full salvation that Christ has earned for us and that the Holy Spirit now applies to us. But how do we know that we shall continue to be Christians throughout our lives? Is there anything that will keep us from falling away from Christ, anything to guarantee that we will remain Christians until we die and that we will in fact live with God in heaven forever? Or might it be that we will turn away from Christ and lose the blessings of our salvation? The topic of the perseverance of the saints speaks to these questions. <span style="font-style:italic;">The perseverance of the saints means that all those who are truly born again will be kept by God&rsquo;s power and will persevere as Christians until the end of their lives, and that only those who persevere until the end have been truly born again</span>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This definition has two parts to it. It indicates first that there is assurance to be given to those who are truly born again, for it reminds them that God&rsquo;s power will keep them as Christians until they die, and they will surely live with Christ in heaven forever. On the other hand, the second half of the definition makes it clear that continuing in the Christian life is one of the evidences that a person is truly born again. It is important to keep this aspect of the doctrine in mind as well, lest false assurance be given to people who were never really believers in the first place.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It should be noted that this question is one on which evangelical Christians have long had significant disagreement. Many within the Wesleyan/Arminian tradition have held that it is possible for someone who is truly born again to lose his or her salvation, while Reformed Christians have held that that is not possible for someone who is <span style="font-style:italic;">truly</span> born again. Most Baptists have followed the Reformed tradition at this point; however, they have frequently used the term &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">eternal security</span>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">eternal security of the believer</span>&rdquo; rather than the term &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">perseverance of the saints</span>.&rdquo;

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">A. All Who Are Truly Born Again Will Persevere to the End</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There are many passages that teach that those who are truly born again, who are genuinely Christians, will continue in the Christian life until death and will then go to be with Christ in heaven. Jesus says,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 789  </span>I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me; and this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that <span style="font-style:italic;">every one who</span> sees the Son and <span style="font-style:italic;">believes in</span> him should have eternal life; and <span style="font-style:italic;">I will raise him up at the last day</span>. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.38-40">John 6:38&ndash;40</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here Jesus says that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life. He says that he will raise that person up at the last day&mdash;which, in this context of believing in the Son and having eternal life, clearly means that Jesus will raise that person up to eternal life with him (not just raise him up to be judged and condemned). It seems hard to avoid the conclusion that everyone who truly believes in Christ will remain a Christian up to the day of final resurrection into the blessings of life in the presence of God. Moreover, this text emphasizes that Jesus does the will of the Father, which is that he should &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">lose nothing</span> of all that he has given me&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.39">John 6:39</a>). Once again, those given to the Son by the Father will not be lost.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another passage emphasizing this truth is <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.27-29">John 10:27&ndash;29</a>, in which Jesus says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life, and <span style="font-style:italic;">they shall never perish</span> and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father&rsquo;s hand.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Here Jesus says that those who follow him, those who are his sheep, are given eternal life. He further says that &ldquo;no one shall snatch them out of my hand&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.28">28</a>). Now some have objected to this that even though no one else can take Christians out of Christ&rsquo;s hand, we might remove ourselves from Christ&rsquo;s hand. But that seems to be pedantic quibbling over words&mdash;does not &ldquo;no one&rdquo; also include the person who is in Christ&rsquo;s hand? Moreover, we know that our own hearts are far from trustworthy. Therefore if the possibility remained that we could remove ourself from Christ&rsquo;s hand, the passage would hardly give the assurance that Jesus intends by it.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But more importantly, the most forceful phrase in the passage is &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">they shall never perish</span>&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.28">28</a>). The Greek construction (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">οὐ</span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el"> </span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μή</span> plus aorist subjunctive) is especially emphatic and might be translated more explicitly, &ldquo;and they shall certainly not perish forever.&rdquo; This emphasizes that those who are Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; and who follow <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 790  </span>him, and to whom he has given eternal life, shall never lose their salvation or be separated from Christ&mdash;they shall &ldquo;never perish.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		There are several other passages that say those who believe have &ldquo;eternal life.&rdquo; One example is <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.36">John 3:36</a>: &ldquo;He who believes in the Son <span style="font-style:italic;">has eternal life</span>&rdquo; (cf. also <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn5.24">John 5:24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.47">6:47</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.28">10:28</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.13">1 John 5:13</a>). Now if this is truly eternal life that believers have, then it is life that lasts forever with God. It is a gift of God that comes with salvation (it is put in contrast to condemnation and eternal judgment in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.16-17">John 3:16&ndash;17</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.36">36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.28">10:28</a>). Arminians have objected that &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; is simply a quality of life, a type of life in relationship with God, which one can have for a time and then lose. But this objection does not seem to be convincing in view of the clear nuance of unending time involved in the adjective <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal</span> (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">αἰώνιος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK173">G173</a>) &ldquo;eternal, without end&rdquo;). Certainly there is a special quality about this life, but the emphasis in the adjective <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal</span> is on the fact that it is the opposite of death; it is the opposite of judgment and separation from God; it is life that goes on forever in the presence of God. And he who believes in the Son has this &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">eternal</span> life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.36">John 3:36</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Evidence in Paul&rsquo;s writings and the other New Testament epistles also indicates that those who are truly born again will persevere to the end. There remains &ldquo;no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>); therefore, it would be unjust for God to give any kind of eternal punishment to those who are Christians&mdash;no condemnation remains for them, for the entire penalty for their sins has been paid.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Then in <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.30">Romans 8:30</a>, Paul emphasizes the clear connection between God&rsquo;s eternal purposes in predestination and his working out of those purposes in life, together with his final realization of those purposes in &ldquo;glorifying&rdquo; or giving final resurrection bodies to those whom he has brought into union with Christ: &ldquo;And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.&rdquo; Here Paul sees the future event of glorification as such a certainty in God&rsquo;s settled purpose that he can speak of it as if it were already accomplished (&ldquo;he also glorified&rdquo;). This is true of all those who are called and justified&mdash;that is, all those who truly become Christians.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Further evidence that God keeps those who are born again safe for eternity is the &ldquo;seal&rdquo; that God places upon us. This &ldquo;seal&rdquo; is the Holy Spirit within us, who <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 791  </span>also acts as God&rsquo;s &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; that we will receive the inheritance promised to us: &ldquo;In him you also, who have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and have believed in him, were <span style="font-style:italic;">sealed with the promised </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span> which is the <span style="font-style:italic;">guarantee</span> of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.13-14">Eph. 1:13&ndash;14</a>). The Greek word translated &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; in this passage (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἀρραβών</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK775">G775</a>) is a legal and commercial term that means &ldquo;first installment, deposit, down payment, pledge&rdquo; and represents &ldquo;a payment which obligates the contracting party to make further payments.&rdquo; When God gave us the Holy Spirit within, he committed himself to give all the further blessings of eternal life and a great reward in heaven with him. This is why Paul can say that the Holy Spirit is the &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">guarantee</span> of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph1.14">Eph. 1:14</a>). All who have the Holy Spirit within them, all who are truly born again, have God&rsquo;s unchanging promise and guarantee that the inheritance of eternal life in heaven will certainly be theirs. God&rsquo;s own faithfulness is pledged to bring it about.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another example of assurance that believers will persevere to the end is found in Paul&rsquo;s statement to the Philippians: &ldquo;I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php1.6">Phil. 1:6</a>). It is true that the word &ldquo;you&rdquo; here is plural (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ὑμᾶς</span>, from <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">σύ</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5148">G5148</a>), and thus he is referring to Christians in the Philippian church generally, but he is still talking about the specific believers to whom he is writing, and saying that God&rsquo;s good work that began in them will continue and will be completed at the day Christ returns. Peter tells his readers that they are those &ldquo;who <span style="font-style:italic;">by God&rsquo;s power are guarded</span> through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.5">1 Peter 1:5</a>). The word <span style="font-style:italic;">guarded</span> (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">φρουρέω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5864">G5864</a>) can mean both &ldquo;kept from escaping&rdquo; and &ldquo;protected from attack,&rdquo; and perhaps both kinds of guarding are intended here: God is preserving believers from escaping out of his kingdom, and he is protecting them from external attacks.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The present participle that Peter uses gives the sense &ldquo;You are continually being guarded.&rdquo; He stresses that this is by God&rsquo;s power. Yet God&rsquo;s power does not work apart from the personal faith of those being guarded, but through their <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 792  </span>faith. (&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">πίστις</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK4411">G4411</a>) is regularly a personal activity of individual believers in Peter&rsquo;s epistles; see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.7">1 Peter 1:7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.9">9</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.21">21</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe5.9">5:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.1">2 Peter 1:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.5">5</a>; and commonly in the New Testament.) The parallel examples of God working &ldquo;through&rdquo; someone or something in Peter&rsquo;s writings (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.3">1 Peter 1:3</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.23">23</a>: <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.4">2 Peter 1:4</a>, and probably also <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.12">1 Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.14">2:14</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe3.1">3:1</a>) suggest that the believer&rsquo;s personal faith or trust in God is the means God uses to guard his people. Thus we might give the sense of the verse by saying that &ldquo;God is continually using his power to guard his people by means of their faith,&rdquo; a statement that seems to imply that God&rsquo;s power in fact energizes and continually sustains individual, personal faith.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This guarding is not for a temporary goal but for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. &ldquo;Salvation&rdquo; is used here not of past justification or of present sanctification (speaking in theological categories) but of the future full possession of all the blessings of our redemption&mdash;of the final, complete fulfillment of our salvation (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro13.11">Rom. 13:11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.2">1 Peter 2:2</a>). Though already prepared or &ldquo;ready,&rdquo; it will not be &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; by God to mankind generally until the &ldquo;last time,&rdquo; the time of final judgment.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This last phrase makes it difficult if not impossible to see any end to God&rsquo;s guarding activity. If God&rsquo;s guarding has as its purpose the preservation of believers until they receive their full, heavenly salvation, then it is safe to conclude that God will accomplish that purpose and they will in fact attain that final salvation. Ultimately their attainment of final salvation depends on God&rsquo;s power. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s power continually works &ldquo;through&rdquo; their faith. Do they wish to know whether God is guarding them? If they continue to trust God through Christ, God is working and guarding them, and he should be thanked.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This emphasis on God&rsquo;s guarding in combination with our faith provides a natural transition to the second half of the doctrine of perseverance.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. Only Those Who Persevere to the End Have Been Truly Born Again</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		While Scripture repeatedly emphasizes that those who are truly born again will persevere to the end and will certainly have eternal life in heaven with God, there are other passages that speak of the necessity of continuing in faith throughout life. They make us realize that what Peter said in <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.5">1 Peter 1:5</a> is true, namely, that God does not guard us <span style="font-style:italic;">apart from</span> our faith, but only by working <span style="font-style:italic;">through</span> our faith so that he enables us to continue to believe in him. In this way, those who continue to trust in Christ gain assurance that God is working in them and guarding them.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One example of this kind of passage is <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn8.31-32">John 8:31&ndash;32</a>: &ldquo;Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, &lsquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">If you continue in my word</span> you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; Jesus is here giving a warning that one evidence of genuine faith is continuing in his word, that is, continuing to believe what he says and living a life of obedience to his <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 793  </span>commands. Similarly, Jesus says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">He who endures to the end</span> will be saved&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.22">Matt. 10:22</a>), as a means of warning people not to fall away in times of persecution.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul says to the Colossian Christians that Christ has reconciled them to God, &ldquo;in order to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him, <span style="font-style:italic;">provided that you continue in the faith</span> stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel which you heard&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.22-23">Col. 1:22&ndash;23</a>). It is only natural that Paul and the other New Testament writers would speak this way, for they are addressing groups of people who profess to be Christians, without being able to know the actual state of every person&rsquo;s heart. There may have been people at Colossae who had joined in the fellowship of the church, and perhaps even professed that they had faith in Christ and had been baptized into membership of the church, but who never had true saving faith. How is Paul to distinguish such people from true believers? How can he avoid giving them false assurance, assurance that they will be saved eternally when in fact they will not, unless they come to true repentance and faith? Paul knows that those whose faith is not real will eventually fall away from participation in the fellowship of the church. Therefore he tells his readers that they will ultimately be saved, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">provided that you continue in the faith</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.23">Col. 1:23</a>). Those who continue show thereby that they are genuine believers. But those who do not continue in the faith show that there was no genuine faith in their hearts in the first place.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A similar emphasis is seen in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.14">Hebrews 3:14</a> (NASB): &ldquo;For we have become partakers of Christ, <span style="font-style:italic;">if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm to the end.</span>&rdquo; This verse provides an excellent perspective on the doctrine of perseverance. How do we know if &ldquo;we have become partakers of Christ&rdquo;? How do we know if this being joined to Christ has happened to us at some time in the past? One way in which we know that we have come to genuine faith in Christ is if we continue in faith until the end of our lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Attention to the context of <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.14">Hebrews 3:14</a> will keep us from using this and other similar passages in a pastorally inappropriate way. We must remember that there are other evidences elsewhere in Scripture that give Christians assurance of salvation, so <span style="font-style:italic;">we should not think that assurance that we belong to Christ is impossible until we die</span>. However, continuing in faith is the one means of assurance that is named here by the author of Hebrews. He mentions this to warn his readers that they should not fall away from Christ, because he is writing to a situation where such a warning is needed. The beginning of that section, just two verses earlier, said, &ldquo;Take care, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.12">Heb. 3:12</a>). In fact, in all of the passages where continuing to believe in Christ to the end of our lives is mentioned as one indication of genuine faith, the purpose is never to make those who are presently trusting in Christ worry that some time in the future they might fall away (and we should never use these passages that way either, for that would be to give wrongful cause for worry in a way that Scripture does not intend). Rather, the purpose is always <span style="font-style:italic;">to warn those who are thinking of falling away or have fallen away</span> that if they do this it is a strong indication that they were never saved in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 794  </span>first place. Thus, the necessity for continuing in faith should just be used as a warning against falling away, a warning that those who fall away give evidence that their faith was never real.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		John clearly states that when people fall away from fellowship with the church and from belief in Christ they thereby show that their faith was not real in the first place and that they were never part of the true body of Christ. Speaking of people who have left the fellowship of believers, John says, &ldquo;They went out from us, but they were not of us; for <span style="font-style:italic;">if they had been of us, they would have continued with us;</span> but they went out, that it might be plain that they all are not of us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.19">1 John 2:19</a>). John says that those who have departed showed by their actions that they &ldquo;were not of us&mdash;that they were not truly born again.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. Those Who Finally Fall Away May Give Many External Signs of Conversion</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Is it always clear which people in the church have genuine saving faith and which have only an intellectual persuasion of the truth of the gospel but no genuine faith in their hearts? It is not always easy to tell, and Scripture mentions in several places that <span style="font-style:italic;">unbelievers</span> in fellowship with the visible church can give some external signs or indications that make them look or sound like genuine believers. For example, Judas, who betrayed Christ, must have acted almost exactly like the other disciples during the three years he was with Jesus. So convincing was his conformity to the behavior pattern of the other disciples, that at the end of three years of Jesus&rsquo; ministry, when he said that one of his disciples would betray him, they did not all turn and suspect Judas, but they rather &ldquo;began to say to him one after another, &ldquo;Is it I?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt26.22">Matt. 26:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk14.19">Mark 14:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk22.23">Luke 22:23</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn13.22">John 13:22</a>). However, Jesus himself knew that there was no genuine faith in Judas&rsquo; heart, because he said at one point, &ldquo;Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.70">John 6:70</a>). John later wrote in his gospel that &ldquo;Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.64">John 6:64</a>). But the disciples themselves did not know.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul also speaks of &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">false brethren</span> secretly brought in&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga2.4">Gal. 2:4</a>), and says that in his journeys he has been &ldquo;in danger from <span style="font-style:italic;">false brethren</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.26">2 Cor. 11:26</a>). He also says that the servants of Satan &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">disguise themselves</span> as servants of righteousness&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co11.15">2 Cor. 11:15</a>). This does not mean that all unbelievers in the church who nevertheless give some signs of true conversion are servants of Satan secretly undermining the work of the church, for some may be in process of considering the claims of the gospel and moving toward real faith, others may have heard only an inadequate explanation of the gospel message, and others may not have come under genuine conviction of the Holy Spirit yet. But Paul&rsquo;s statements do mean that some unbelievers in the church will be false brothers and sisters sent to disrupt the fellowship, while others will simply be unbelievers who will eventually come to genuine saving faith. In both cases, however, they give several external signs that make them look like genuine believers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		We can see this also in Jesus&rsquo; statement about what will happen at the last judgment:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 795  </span>Not every one who says to me, &ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo; shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, &ldquo;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?&rdquo; And then will I declare to them, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">I never knew you;</span> depart from me, you evildoers.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.21-23">Matt. 7:21&ndash;23</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Although these people prophesied and cast out demons and did &ldquo;many mighty works&rdquo; in Jesus&rsquo; name, the ability to do such works did not guarantee that they were Christians. Jesus says, &ldquo;I never knew you.&rdquo; He does not say, &ldquo;I knew you at one time but I no longer know you,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;I knew you at one time but you strayed away from me,&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;I <span style="font-style:italic;">never</span> knew you.&rdquo; They never were genuine believers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A similar teaching is found in the parable of the sower in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk4">Mark 4</a>. Jesus says, &ldquo;Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk4.5-6">Mark 4:5&ndash;6</a>). Jesus explains that the seed sown upon rocky ground represents people who &ldquo;when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy; and <span style="font-style:italic;">they have no root in themselves</span> but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk4.16-17">Mark 4:16&ndash;17</a>). The fact that they &ldquo;have no root in themselves&rdquo; indicates that there is no source of life within these plants; similarly, the people represented by them have no genuine life of their own within. They have an appearance of conversion and they apparently have become Christians because they receive the word &ldquo;with joy,&rdquo; but when difficulty comes, they are nowhere to be found&mdash;their apparent conversion was not genuine and there was no real saving faith in their hearts.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The importance of continuing in faith is also affirmed in the parable of Jesus as the vine, in which Christians are portrayed as branches (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.1-7">John 15:1&ndash;7</a>). Jesus says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit … If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.1-2">John 15:1&ndash;2</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.6">6</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Arminians have argued that the branches that do not bear fruit are still true branches on the vine&mdash;Jesus refers to &ldquo;Every branch <span style="font-style:italic;">of mine</span> that bears no fruit&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.2">2</a>). Therefore the branches that are gathered and thrown into the fire and burned must refer to true believers that were once part of the vine but fell away and became subject to eternal judgment. But that is not a necessary implication of Jesus&rsquo; teaching at this point. The imagery of the vine used in this parable is limited in how much detail it can teach. In fact, if Jesus had wanted to teach that there were true and false believers associated with him, and if he wanted to use the analogy of a vine and branches, then the only way he could refer to people who do not have genuine life in themselves would be to speak of branches that bear no fruit (somewhat after the analogy of the seeds that fell on rocky ground and had &ldquo;no root in themselves&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mk4.17">Mark 4:17</a>). Here in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15">John 15</a> the branches that do not bear fruit, though they are in some way connected to Jesus and give an outward appearance of being genuine branches, nonetheless give indication of their true state by the fact that they bear no fruit. This is similarly indicated by the fact that <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 796  </span>the person &ldquo;does not abide&rdquo; in Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.6">John 15:6</a>) and is cast off as a branch and withers. If we try to press the analogy any further, by saying, for example, that all branches on a vine really are alive or they would not be there in the first place, then we are simply trying to press the imagery beyond what it is able to teach&mdash;and in that case there would be nothing in the analogy that could represent false believers in any case. The point of the imagery is simply that those who bear fruit thereby give evidence that they are abiding in Christ; those who do not, are not abiding in him.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, there are two passages in Hebrews that also affirm that those who finally fall away may give many external signs of conversion and may look in many ways like Christians. The first of these, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">Hebrews 6:4&ndash;6</a>, has frequently been used by Arminians as proof that believers can lose their salvation. But on closer inspection such an interpretation is not convincing. The author writes,
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they then commit apostasy, since they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">Heb. 6:4&ndash;6</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The author continues with an example from agriculture:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.7-8">Heb. 6:7&ndash;8</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this agricultural metaphor, those who receive final judgment are compared to land that bears no vegetation or useful fruit, but rather bears thorns and thistles. When we recall the other metaphors in Scripture where good fruit is a sign of true spiritual life and fruitlessness is a sign of false believers (for example, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt3.8-10">Matt. 3:8&ndash;10</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.15-20">7:15&ndash;20</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.33-35">12:33&ndash;35</a>), we already have an indication that the author is speaking of people whose most trustworthy evidence of their spiritual condition (the fruit they bear) is negative, suggesting that the author is talking about people who are not genuinely Christians.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Some have objected that the long description of things that have happened to these people who fall away means that they must have been genuinely born again. But that is not a convincing objection when we look at the individual terms used. The author says they have &ldquo;once been <span style="font-style:italic;">enlightened</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4">Heb. 6:4</a>). But this enlightening simply means that they came to understand the truths of the gospel, not that they responded to those truths with genuine saving faith.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Similarly, the word <span style="font-style:italic;">once</span> that is used to speak of those who &ldquo;have once been <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 797  </span>enlightened&rdquo; is the Greek term <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἅπαξ</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK562">G562</a>) which is used, for example, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Php4.16">Philippians 4:16</a> of the Philippians&rsquo; sending Paul a gift &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">once</span> and again,&rdquo; and in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb9.7">Hebrews 9:7</a> of entrance in the Holy of Holies &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">once</span> a year.&rdquo; Therefore, this word does not mean that something happened &ldquo;once&rdquo; and can never be repeated, but simply that it happened once, without specifying whether it will be repeated or not.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The text further says that these people &ldquo;have <span style="font-style:italic;">tasted</span> the heavenly gift&rdquo; and that they &ldquo;have <span style="font-style:italic;">tasted</span> the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-5">Heb. 6:4&ndash;5</a>). Inherent in the idea of tasting is the fact that the tasting is temporary and one might or might not decide to accept the thing that is tasted. For example, the same Greek word (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">γεύομαι</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1174">G1174</a>) is used in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt27.34">Matthew 27:34</a> to say that those crucifying Jesus &ldquo;offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he <span style="font-style:italic;">tasted</span> it, he would not drink it.&rdquo; The word is also used in a figurative sense meaning &ldquo;come to know something.&rdquo; If we understand it in this figurative sense, as it must be understood here since the passage is not talking about tasting literal food, then it means that these people have come to understand the heavenly gift (which probably means here that they had experienced some of the power of the Holy Spirit at work) and to know something of the Word of God and the powers of the age to come. It does not necessarily mean that they had (or did not have) genuine saving faith, but may simply mean that they came to understand it and have some experience of spiritual power.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The text also further says that these people &ldquo;have become <span style="font-style:italic;">partakers</span> of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4">Heb. 6:4</a>). The question here is the exact meaning of the word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μέτοχος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3581">G3581</a>) which is here translated &ldquo;partaker.&rdquo; It is not always clear to English-speaking readers that this term has a range of meaning and may imply very close participation and attachment, or may only imply a loose association with the other person or persons named. For example, the context shows that in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.14">Hebrews 3:14</a> to become a &ldquo;partaker&rdquo; of Christ means to have a very close participation with him in a saving relationship. On the other hand, <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μέτοχος</span> can also be used in a much looser sense, simply to refer to associates or companions. We read that when the disciples took in a great catch of fish so that their nets were breaking, &ldquo;they <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 798  </span>beckoned to their <span style="font-style:italic;">partners</span> in the other boat to come and help them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk5.7">Luke 5:7</a>). Here it simply refers to those who were companions or partners with Peter and the other disciples in their fishing work. <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.7">Ephesians 5:7</a> uses a closely related word (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">συμμέτοχος</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5212">G5212</a>, a compound of <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μέτοχος</span> and the preposition <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">σύν</span> [<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK5250">G5250</a>, &ldquo;with&rdquo;]) when Paul warns Christians about the sinful acts of unbelievers and says, &ldquo;do not associate with them&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eph5.7">Eph. 5:7</a>). He is not concerned that their total nature will be transformed by the unbelievers, but simply that they will associate with them and have their own witness compromised and their own lives influenced to some degree by them.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		By analogy, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">Hebrews 6:4&ndash;6</a> speaks of people who have been &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">associated with</span>&rdquo; the Holy Spirit, and thereby had their lives influenced by him, but it need not imply that they had a redeeming work of the Holy Spirit in their lives, or that they were regenerated. By similar analogy with the example of the fishing companions in <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk5.7">Luke 5:7</a>, Peter and the disciples could be <span style="font-style:italic;">associated with</span> them and even to some degree influenced by them without having a thoroughgoing change of life caused by that association. The very word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μέτοχος</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3581">G3581</a>) allows for a range of influence from fairly weak to fairly strong, for it only means &ldquo;one who participates with or shares with or accompanies in some activity.&rdquo; This was apparently what had happened to these people spoken of in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6">Hebrews 6</a>, who had been associated with the church and as such associated with the work of the Holy Spirit, and no doubt had been influenced by him in some ways in their lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, the text says that it is impossible &ldquo;to restore again to <span style="font-style:italic;">repentance</span>&rdquo; people who have experienced these things and have then committed apostasy. Some have argued that if this is a repentance to which they need to be restored again, then it must be genuine repentance. But this is not necessarily the case. First, we must realize that &ldquo;repentance&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μετάνοια</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3567">G3567</a>) does not need to refer to inward heart <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 799  </span>repentance unto salvation. For example, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.17">Hebrews 12:17</a> uses this word to speak of a change of mind that Esau sought concerning the sale of his birthright, and refers to it as &ldquo;repentance&rdquo; (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μετάνοια</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3567">G3567</a>). This would not have been a repentance for salvation, but simply a change of mind and an undoing of the transaction regarding his birthright. (Note also the example of Judas&rsquo; repentance in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt27.3">Matt. 27:3</a>&mdash;howbeit with a different Greek word.)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The cognate verb &ldquo;to repent&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">μετανοέω</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK3566">G3566</a>) is sometimes used to refer not to saving repentance, but just to sorrow for individual offenses in <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk17.3-4">Luke 17:3&ndash;4</a>: &ldquo;If your brother sins, rebuke him, and <span style="font-style:italic;">if he repents</span> forgive him; and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, and says, &ldquo;I repent,&rsquo; you must forgive him.&rdquo; We conclude that &ldquo;repentance&rdquo; simply means a sorrow for actions that have been done or for sins that have been committed. Whether or not it is a genuine saving repentance, a &ldquo;repentance unto salvation,&rdquo; may not be always evident right away. The author of Hebrews is not concerned to specify whether it is a genuine repentance or not. He is simply saying that if someone has a sorrow for sin and comes to understand the gospel and experiences these various blessings of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work (no doubt in fellowship with the church), and then turns away, it will not be possible to restore such a person again to a place of sorrow for sin. But this does not necessarily imply that the repentance was genuine saving repentance in the first place.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At this point we may ask what kind of person is described by all of these terms. These are no doubt people who have been affiliated closely with the fellowship of the church. They have had some sorrow for sin (repentance). They have clearly understood the gospel (they have been enlightened). They have come to appreciate the attractiveness of the Christian life and the change that comes about in people&rsquo;s lives because of becoming a Christian, and they have probably had answers to prayer in their own lives and felt the power of the Holy Spirit at work, perhaps even using some spiritual gifts in the manner of the unbelievers in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.22">Matthew 7:22</a> (they have become &ldquo;associated with&rdquo; the work of the Holy Spirit or have become &ldquo;partakers&rdquo; of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the heavenly gift and the powers of the age of come). They have been exposed to the true preaching of the Word and have appreciated much of its teachings (they have tasted the goodness of the Word of God).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But then in spite of all this, if they &ldquo;commit apostasy&rdquo; and &ldquo;crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.6">Heb. 6:6</a>), then they are willfully rejecting all of these blessings and turning decidedly against them. Perhaps all of us have known in our own churches people who (sometimes by their own profession) have long been affiliated with the fellowship of the church but are not themselves born-again Christians. They have thought about the gospel for years and have continued to resist the wooing of the Holy Spirit in their lives, perhaps through an unwillingness to give up lordship of their lives to Jesus and preferring to cling to it themselves.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now the author tells us that <span style="font-style:italic;">if these people willfully turn away from all of these temporary blessings</span> then it will be impossible to restore them again to any kind of repentance or sorrow for sin. Their hearts will be hardened and their consciences calloused. What more could be done to bring them to salvation? If we tell them Scripture is true they will say that they know it but they have decided to reject it. If we tell them God answers prayer and changes lives they will respond that they <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 800  </span>know that as well, but they want nothing of it. If we tell them that the Holy Spirit is powerful to work in people&rsquo;s lives and the gift of eternal life is good beyond description, they will say that they understand that, but they want nothing of it. Their repeated familiarity with the things of God and their experience of many influences of the Holy Spirit has simply served to harden them against conversion.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now the author of Hebrews knows that there are some in the community to which he writes who are in danger of falling away in just this way (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb2.3">Heb. 2:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.8">3:8</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.12">12</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.14-15">14&ndash;15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.1">4:1</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.7">7</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb4.11">11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.26">10:26</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.29">29</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.35-36">35&ndash;36</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.38-39">38&ndash;39</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.3">12:3</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb12.15-17">15&ndash;17</a>). He wants to warn them that, though they have participated in the fellowship of the church and experienced a number of God&rsquo;s blessings in their lives, yet if they fall away after all that, there is no salvation for them. This does not imply that he thinks that true Christians could fall away&mdash;<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.14">Hebrews 3:14</a> implies quite the opposite. But he wants them to gain assurance of salvation through their continuing in faith, and thereby implies that if they fall away it would show that they never were Christ&rsquo;s people in the first place (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.6">Heb. 3:6</a>: &ldquo;We are his house <span style="font-style:italic;">if</span> we hold fast our confidence and pride in our hope&rdquo;).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore the author wants to give a severe warning to those in danger of slipping away from their Christian profession. He wants to use the strongest language possible to say, &ldquo;Here is how far a person can come in experiencing <span style="font-style:italic;">temporary blessings</span> and still not really be saved.&rdquo; He is warning them to watch out, because depending on temporary blessings and experiences is not enough. To do this he talks not of any true change of heart or any good fruit produced, but simply about the temporary blessings and experiences that have come to these persons and have given them some understanding of Christianity.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For this reason he immediately passes from this description of those who commit apostasy to a further analogy that shows that these people who fell away never had any genuine fruit in their lives. As we explained above, verses <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.7-8">7&ndash;8</a> speak of these people in terms of &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">thorns and thistles,</span>&rdquo; the kind of crop that is brought forth on land that has no worthwhile life in itself even though it receives repeated blessings from God (in terms of the analogy, even though rain frequently falls upon it). We should notice here that people who commit apostasy are not compared to a field that once bore good fruit and now does not, but that they are like <span style="font-style:italic;">land that never bore good fruit</span> but only thorns and thistles. The land may look good before the crops start to come up, but the fruit gives the genuine evidence, and it is bad.

		Strong support for this interpretation of <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-8">Hebrews 6:4&ndash;8</a> is found in the verse immediately following. Though the author has been speaking very harshly about the possibility of falling away, he then returns to speak to the situation of the great majority of the hearers, whom he thinks to be genuine Christians. He says, &ldquo;Though we speak thus, <span style="font-style:italic;">yet in your case</span> beloved, <span style="font-style:italic;">we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.9">Heb. 6:9</a>). But the question is &ldquo;better things&rdquo; than what? The plural &ldquo;better things&rdquo; forms an appropriate contrast to the &ldquo;good things&rdquo; that have been mentioned in verses <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">4&ndash;6</a>: the author is convinced that most of his readers have experienced better things than simply the partial and temporary influences of the Holy Spirit and the church talked about in verses <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">4&ndash;6</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, the author talks about these things by saying (literally) that they are <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 801  </span>&ldquo;better things, <span style="font-style:italic;">also belonging to salvation</span>&rdquo; (Gk. <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">καὶ</span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el"> </span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἐχόμενα</span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el"> </span><span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">σωτηρίας</span>). These are not only the temporary blessings talked about in verses <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">4&ndash;6</a>, but these are better things, things having not only temporary influence, but &ldquo;also belonging to salvation.&rdquo; In this way the Greek word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">καί</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2779">G2779</a>, &ldquo;also&rdquo;) shows that salvation is something that was not part of the things mentioned in verses <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">4&ndash;6</a> above. Therefore this word <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">καί</span> which is not explicitly translated in the RSV or NIV (but the NASB comes close), provides a crucial key for understanding the passage. If the author had meant to say that the people mentioned in verses <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">4&ndash;6</a> were truly saved, then it is very difficult to understand why he would say in verse <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.9">9</a> that he is convinced of <span style="font-style:italic;">better things</span> for them, things that belong to salvation, or that have salvation in addition to those things mentioned above. He thus shows that he can use a brief phrase to say that people &ldquo;have salvation&rdquo; if he wishes to do so (he does not need to pile up many phrases), and he shows, moreover, that the people whom he speaks of in verses <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.4-6">4&ndash;6</a> are not saved.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		What exactly are these &ldquo;better things&rdquo;? In addition to salvation mentioned in verse <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.9">9</a>, they are things that give real evidence of salvation&mdash;genuine fruit in their lives (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.10">10</a>), full assurance of hope (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.11">11</a>), and saving faith, of the type exhibited by those who inherit the promises (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.12">12</a>). In this way he reassures those who are genuine believers&mdash;those who show fruit in their lives and show love for other Christians, who show hope and genuine faith that is continuing at the present time, and who are not about to fall away. He wants to reassure these readers (who are certainly the great majority of the ones to whom he writes) while still issuing a strong warning to those among them who may be in danger of falling away.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		A similar teaching is found in <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.26-31">Hebrews 10:26&ndash;31</a>. There the author says, &ldquo;If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.26">26</a> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">niv</span>). A person who rejects Christ&rsquo;s salvation and &ldquo;has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.29">29</a> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">niv</span>) deserves eternal punishment. This again is a strong warning against falling away, but it should not be taken as proof that someone who has truly been born again can lose his or her salvation. When the author talks about the blood of the covenant &ldquo;that sanctified him,&rdquo; the word <span style="font-style:italic;">sanctified</span> is used simply to refer to &ldquo;external sanctification, like that of the ancient Israelites, by outward connection with God&rsquo;s people.&rdquo; The passage does not talk about someone who is genuinely <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 802  </span>saved, but someone who has received some beneficial moral influence through contact with the church.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		One other passage in John&rsquo;s writings has been claimed to teach the possibility of loss of salvation. In <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.5">Revelation 3:5</a>, Jesus says, &ldquo;He who conquers shall be clad thus in white garments, and <span style="font-style:italic;">I will not blot his name out of the book of life.</span>&rdquo; Some have claimed that when Jesus says this he implies that it is possible that he would blot out the names of some people from the book of life, people who had already had their names written in it and were thus already saved. But the fact that Jesus emphatically states that he will <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> do something should not be taken as teaching that he will do that same thing in other cases! The same kind of Greek construction is used to give an emphatic negation in <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn10.28">John 10:28</a>, where Jesus says, &ldquo;I give them eternal life, and <span style="font-style:italic;">they shall never perish.</span>&rdquo; This does not mean that there are some of Jesus&rsquo; sheep who do not hear his voice and follow him and who will perish; it is simply affirming that his sheep certainly will not perish. Similarly, when God says, &ldquo;I will never fail you nor forsake you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb13.5">Heb. 13:5</a>), it does not imply that he will leave or forsake others; it just emphatically states that he will not leave nor forsake his people. Or, in even a closer parallel, in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.32">Matthew 12:32</a>, Jesus says, &ldquo;Whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit <span style="font-style:italic;">will not be forgiven</span> either in this age <span style="font-style:italic;">or in the age to come.</span>&rdquo; This does not imply that some sins will be forgiven in the age to come (as Roman Catholics claim in support for the doctrine of purgatory)&mdash;that is simply an error in reasoning: to say that something will not happen in the age to come does not imply that it might happen in the age to come! In the same way, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re3.5">Revelation 3:5</a> is just a strong assurance that those who are clad in the white garments and who have remained faithful to Christ will not have their names blotted out of the book of life.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, one passage from the Old Testament is sometimes used to argue that people can lose their salvation: the story of the Holy Spirit departing from King Saul. But Saul should not be taken as an example of someone who lost his salvation, for when &ldquo;the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> departed from Saul&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa16.14">1 Sam. 16:14</a>), it was immediately after Samuel had anointed David king and &ldquo;the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> came mightily upon David from that day forward&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Sa16.13">1 Sam. 16:13</a>). In fact, the Spirit of the Lord coming upon David is reported in the immediately previous sentence to the one in which we read that the Spirit departed from Saul. This close connection means that Scripture is not here talking about a total loss of all work of the Holy Spirit in Saul&rsquo;s life, but simply about the withdrawing of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s function of empowering Saul as king. But that does not mean that Saul <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 803  </span>was eternally condemned. It is simply very hard to tell from the pages of the Old Testament whether Saul, throughout his life, was (a) an unregenerate man who had leadership capabilities and was used by God as a demonstration of the fact that someone worthy to be king in the eyes of the world was not thereby suited to be king over the Lord&rsquo;s people, or (b) a regenerate man with poor understanding and a life that increasingly strayed from the Lord.

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">D. What Can Give a Believer Genuine Assurance?</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If it is true, as explained in the previous section, that those who are unbelievers and who finally fall away may give many external signs of conversion, then what will serve as evidence of genuine conversion? What can give real assurance to a real believer? We can list three categories of questions that a person could ask of himself or herself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Do I Have a Present Trust in Christ for </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Salvation</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">?</span> Paul tells the Colossians that they will be saved on the last day, &ldquo;provided that you <span style="font-style:italic;">continue in the faith</span> stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel which you heard&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col1.23">Col. 1:23</a>). The author of Hebrews says, &ldquo;We share in Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb3.14">Heb. 3:14</a>) and encourages his readers to be imitators of those &ldquo;who <span style="font-style:italic;">through faith</span> and patience inherit the promises&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.12">Heb. 6:12</a>). In fact, the most famous verse in the entire Bible uses a present tense verb that may be translated, &ldquo;whoever continues believing in him&rdquo; may have eternal life (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn3.16">John 3:16</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Therefore a person should ask himself or herself, &ldquo;Do I today have trust in Christ to forgive my sins and take me without blame into heaven forever? Do I have confidence in my heart that he has saved me? If I were to die tonight and stand before God&rsquo;s judgment seat, and if he were to ask me why he should let me into heaven, would I begin to think of my good deeds and depend on them, or would I without hesitation say that I am depending on the merits of Christ and am confident that he is a sufficient Savior?&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This emphasis on <span style="font-style:italic;">present</span> faith in Christ stands in contrast to the practice of some church &ldquo;testimonies&rdquo; where people repeatedly recite details of a conversion experience that may have happened 20 or 30 years ago. If a testimony of saving faith is genuine, it should be a testimony of faith that is active this very day.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Is There Evidence of a Regenerating Work of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Holy Spirit</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> in My Heart?</span> The evidence of the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts comes in many different forms. Although we should not put confidence in the demonstration of miraculous works (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.22">Matt. 7:22</a>), or long hours and years of work at some local church (which may simply be building with &ldquo;wood, hay, straw&rdquo; [in terms of <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.12">1 Cor. 3:12</a>] to further one&rsquo;s own ego or power over others, or to attempt to earn merit with God), there are many other evidences of a real work of the Holy Spirit in one&rsquo;s heart.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 804  </span>First, there is a subjective testimony of the Holy Spirit within our hearts bearing witness that we are God&rsquo;s children (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.15-16">Rom. 8:15&ndash;16</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.13">1 John 4:13</a>). This testimony will usually be accompanied by a sense of being led by the Holy Spirit in paths of obedience to God&rsquo;s will (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.14">Rom. 8:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In addition, if the Holy Spirit is genuinely at work in our lives, he will be producing the kind of character traits that Paul calls &ldquo;the fruit of the Spirit&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.22">Gal. 5:22</a>). He lists several attitudes and character traits that are produced by the Holy Spirit: &ldquo;love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ga5.22-23">Gal. 5:22&ndash;23</a>). Of course, the question is not, &ldquo;Do I perfectly exemplify all of these characteristics in my life?&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;Are these things a general characteristic of my life? Do I sense these attitudes in my heart? Do others (especially those closest to me) see these traits exhibited in my life? Have I been growing in them over a period of years?&rdquo; There is no suggestion in the New Testament that any non-Christian, any unregenerate person, can convincingly fake these character traits, especially for those who know the person most closely.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Related to this kind of fruit is another kind of fruit&mdash;the results of one&rsquo;s life and ministry as they have influence on others and on the church. There are some people who profess to be Christians but whose influence on others is to discourage them, to drag them down, to injure their faith, and to provoke controversy and divisiveness. The result of their life and ministry is not to build up others and to build up the church, but to tear it down. On the other hand, there are those who seem to edify others in every conversation, every prayer, and every work of ministry they put their hand to. Jesus said, regarding false prophets, &ldquo;You will know them by their fruits … Every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit … Thus you will know them by their fruits&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt7.16-20">Matt. 7:16&ndash;20</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another evidence of work of the Holy Spirit is continuing to believe and accept the sound teaching of the church. Those who begin to deny major doctrines of the faith give serious negative indications concerning their salvation: &ldquo;No one who denies the Son has the Father … If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.23-24">1 John 2:23&ndash;24</a>). John also says, &ldquo;Whoever knows God listens to us, and he who is not of God does not listen to us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.6">1 John 4:6</a>). Since the New Testament writings are the current replacement for the apostles like John, we might also say that whoever knows God will continue to read and to delight in God&rsquo;s Word, and will continue to believe it fully. Those who do not believe and delight in God&rsquo;s Word give evidence that they are not &ldquo;of God.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Another evidence of genuine salvation is a continuing present relationship with Jesus Christ. Jesus says, &ldquo;Abide in me, and I in you&rdquo; and, &ldquo;If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.4">John 15:4</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn15.7">7</a>). This abiding in Christ will include not only day-by-day trust in him in various situations, but also certainly regular fellowship with him in prayer and worship.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Finally, a major area of evidence that we are genuine believers is found in a life of obedience to God&rsquo;s commands. John says, &ldquo;He who says &ldquo;I know him&rsquo; but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps his word, in him truly love for God is perfected. By this we may be sure that we are in him: he who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 805  </span>which he walked&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.4-6">1 John 2:4&ndash;6</a>). A perfect life is not necessary, of course. John is rather saying that in general our lives ought to be ones of imitation of Christ and likeness to him in what we do and say. If we have genuine saving faith, there will be clear results in obedience in our lives (see also <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.9-10">1 John 3:9&ndash;10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.24">24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.18">5:18</a>). Thus James can say, &ldquo;Faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead&rdquo; and &ldquo;I by my works will show you my faith&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jas2.17-18">James 2:17&ndash;18</a>). One large area of obedience to God includes love for fellow Christians. &ldquo;He who loves his brother abides in the light&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.10">1 John 2:10</a>). &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.14">1 John 3:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.17">3:17</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.7">4:7</a>). One evidence of this love is continuing in Christian fellowship (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn2.19">1 John 2:19</a>), and another is giving to a brother in need (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn3.17">1 John 3:17</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">Matt. 25:31&ndash;46</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Do I See a Long-Term Pattern of Growth in My Christian Life?</span> The first two areas of assurance dealt with present faith and present evidence of the Holy Spirit at work in our lives. But Peter gives one more kind of test that we can use to ask whether we are genuinely believers. He tells us that there are some character traits which, if we keep on increasing in them, will guarantee that we will &ldquo;never fall&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.10">2 Peter 1:10</a>). He tells his readers to add to their faith &ldquo;virtue … knowledge … self-control … steadfastness … godliness … brotherly affection … love&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.5-7">2 Peter 1:5&ndash;7</a>). Then he says that these things are to belong to his readers and to continually &ldquo;abound&rdquo; in their lives (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.8">2 Peter 1:8</a>). He adds that they are to &ldquo;be the more zealous to confirm your call and election&rdquo; and says then that &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">if you do this</span> (literally, &ldquo;these things,&rdquo; referring to the character traits mentioned in vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.5-7">5&ndash;7</a>) <span style="font-style:italic;">you will never fall</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.10">2 Peter 1:10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The way that we confirm our call and election, then, is to continue to grow in &ldquo;these things.&rdquo; This implies that our assurance of salvation can be something that increases over time in our lives. Every year that we add to these character traits in our lives, we gain greater and greater assurance of our salvation. Thus, though young believers can have a quite strong confidence in their salvation, that assurance can increase to even deeper certainty over the years in which they grow toward Christian maturity. If they continue to add these things they will confirm their call and election and will &ldquo;never fall.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The result of these three questions that we can ask ourselves should be to give strong assurance to those who are genuinely believers. In this way the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints will be a tremendously comforting doctrine. No one who has such assurance should wonder, &ldquo;Will I be able to persevere to the end of my life and therefore be saved?&rdquo; Everyone who gains assurance through such a self-examination should rather think, &ldquo;I am truly born again; therefore, I will certainly persevere to the end, because I am being guarded &ldquo;by God&rsquo;s power&rsquo; working through my faith (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.5">1 Peter 1:5</a>) and therefore I will never be lost. Jesus will raise me up at the last day and I will enter into his kingdom forever&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.40">John 6:40</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		On the other hand, this doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, if rightly understood, should cause genuine worry, and even fear, in the hearts of any who <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 806  </span>are &ldquo;backsliding&rdquo; or straying away from Christ. Such persons must clearly be warned that only those who persevere to the end have been truly born again. If they fall away from their profession of faith in Christ and life of obedience to him, they may not really be saved&mdash;in fact, the <span style="font-style:italic;">evidence</span> that they are giving <span style="font-style:italic;">is that they are not saved</span> and they never really were saved. Once they stop trusting in Christ and obeying him (I am speaking in terms of outward evidence) they have no genuine assurance of salvation, and they should consider themselves unsaved, and turn to Christ in repentance and ask him for forgiveness of their sins.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At this point, in terms of pastoral care with those who have strayed away from their Christian profession, we should realize that <span style="font-style:italic;">Calvinists and Arminians</span> (those who believe in the perseverance of the saints and those who think that Christians can lose their salvation) <span style="font-style:italic;">will both counsel a &ldquo;backslider&rdquo; in the same way</span>. According to the Arminian this person was a Christian at one time but is no longer a Christian. According to the Calvinist, such a person never really was a Christian in the first place and is not one now. But in both cases the biblical counsel given would be the same: &ldquo;You do not appear to be a Christian now&mdash;you must repent of your sins and trust in Christ for your salvation!&rdquo; Though the Calvinist and Arminian would differ on their interpretation of the previous history, they would agree on what should be done in the present.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But here we see why the phrase <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal security</span> can be quite misleading. In some evangelical churches, instead of teaching the full and balanced presentation of the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, pastors have sometimes taught a watered-down version, which in effect tells people that all who have once made a profession of faith and been baptized are &ldquo;eternally secure.&rdquo; The result is that some people who are not genuinely converted at all may &ldquo;come forward&rdquo; at the end of an evangelistic sermon to profess faith in Christ, and may be baptized shortly after that, but then they leave the fellowship of the church and live a life no different from the one they lived before they gained this &ldquo;eternal security.&rdquo; In this way people are given false assurance and are being cruelly deceived into thinking they are going to heaven when in fact they are not.

Do you think that God wants true believers to go on throughout life worrying about whether they are really born again, or to have firm assurance that they are his people? (See <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn5.13">1 John 5:13</a>.) Have you seen a pattern of growth in your Christian life over time? Are you trusting in your own power to keep on believing in Christ, or in God&rsquo;s power to keep your faith active and alive?

If you have doubts about whether you are truly born again, what is it in your life that is giving reason for those doubts? What would Scripture encourage you to do to resolve those doubts (see <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe1.5-11">2 Peter 1:5&ndash;11</a>; also <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.28-30">Matt. 11:28&ndash;30</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jn6.37">John 6:37</a>)? Do you think that Jesus now knows about your doubts and understands them? What do you think he would like you to do now to gain greater assurance of salvation?
	</p>

		 3. Have you known people, perhaps in your church, whose &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; is always destructive or divisive or harmful to the ministry of the church and the faith of others? Do they have very much influence, perhaps even positions of leadership in the church? Do you think that an evaluation of the fruit of one&rsquo;s life and influence on others should be a qualification for church leadership? Is it possible that people would profess agreement with every true Christian doctrine and still not be born again? What are some more reliable evidences of genuine conversion other than intellectual adherence to sound doctrine?

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:72pt; text-indent:-18pt;" lang="en-US">
		In the depth of midnight blasting, God shall be thy sure defence:

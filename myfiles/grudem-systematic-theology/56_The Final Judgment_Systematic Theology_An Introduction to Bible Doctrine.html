	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Scriptural Evidence for a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Judgment</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Scripture frequently affirms the fact that there will be a great final judgment of believers and unbelievers. They will stand before the judgment seat of Christ in resurrected bodies and hear his proclamation of their eternal destiny.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The final judgment is vividly portrayed in John&rsquo;s vision in Revelation:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-style:italic;">Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it</span>; from his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. <span style="font-style:italic;">And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened</span>. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. <span style="font-style:italic;">And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done</span>. And the sea gave up the dead in it, death and hades gave up the dead in them, and all were judged by what they had done. Then death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire; and if anyone&rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.11-15">Rev. 20:11&ndash;15</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Many other passages teach this final judgment. Paul tells the Greek philosophers in Athens that God &ldquo;Now … commands all men everywhere to repent, because <span style="font-style:italic;">he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness</span> by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.30-31">Acts 17:30&ndash;31</a>). Similarly, Paul talks about &ldquo;the day of wrath when God&rsquo;s righteous judgment will be revealed&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.5">Rom. 2:5</a>). Other passages speak clearly of a coming day of judgment (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt10.15">Matt. 10:15</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.22">11:22</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.24">24</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.36">12:36</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">25:31&ndash;46</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.5">1 Cor. 4:5</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb6.2">Heb. 6:2</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Jud6">Jude 6</a>; et al.).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This final judgment is the culmination of many precursors in which God rewarded righteousness or punished unrighteousness throughout history. While <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1141  </span>he brought blessing and deliverance from danger to those who were faithful to him, including Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and the faithful among the people of Israel, he also from time to time brought judgment on those who persisted in disobedience and unbelief: his judgments included the flood, the dispersion of the people from the tower of Babel, the judgments on Sodom and Gomorrah, and continuing judgments throughout history, both on individuals (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro1.18-32">Rom. 1:18&ndash;32</a>) and on nations (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is13-23">Isa. 13&ndash;23</a>; et al.) who persisted in sin. Moreover, in the unseen spiritual realm he brought judgment on angels who sinned (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a>). Peter reminds us that God&rsquo;s judgments have been carried out periodically and with certainty, and this reminds us that a final judgment is yet coming, for &ldquo;the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteousness under punishment until the day of judgment, and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.9-10">2 Peter 2:9&ndash;10</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Will There Be More Than One Judgment?</span> According to a dispensational view, there is more than one judgment to come. For example, dispensationalists would not see the final judgment in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">Matthew 25:31&ndash;46</a>:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. <span style="font-style:italic;">Before him will be gathered all the nations</span> and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at his left. Then the King will say to those at his right hand, &ldquo;Come, O blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food … As you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.&rdquo; Then he will say to those at his left hand, &ldquo;Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food … As you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.&rdquo; And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		From a dispensational perspective, this passage does not refer to final judgment (the &ldquo;great white throne judgment&rdquo; spoken of in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.11-15">Rev. 20:11&ndash;15</a>), but rather to a judgment that comes after the tribulation and before the beginning of the millennium. They say that this will be a &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">judgment of the nations</span>&rdquo; in which the nations are judged according to how they have treated the Jewish people during the tribulation. Those who have treated the Jews well and are willing to submit to Christ will enter into the millennium, and those who have not will be refused entrance.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Thus, in a dispensationalist view there are different judgments: (a) a &ldquo;judgment of the nations&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">Matt. 25:31&ndash;46</a>) to determine who enters the millennium; (b) a &ldquo;judgment of believers&rsquo; works&rdquo; (sometimes called the <span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">βῆμα</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK1037">G1037</a>) judgment after the Greek word for &ldquo;judgment seat&rdquo; in <a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>) in which Christians will receive degrees of reward; and (c) a &ldquo;great white throne judgment&rdquo; at the end of the millennium (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.11-15">Rev. 20:11&ndash;15</a>) to declare eternal punishments for unbelievers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The view taken in this book is that these three passages all speak of the same final judgment, not of three separate judgments. With regard to <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">Matthew 25:31&ndash;</a><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1142  </span><a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">46</a> in particular, it is unlikely that the dispensational view is correct: There is no mention of entering into the millennium in this passage. Moreover, the judgments pronounced speak not of entrance into the millennial kingdom on earth or exclusion from that kingdom but of eternal destinies of people: &ldquo;Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world … Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels … And they will go away into <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal punishment</span> but the righteous into <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal life</span>&rdquo; (vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.34">34</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.41">41</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.46">46</a>). Finally, it would be inconsistent with God&rsquo;s ways throughout Scripture to deal with people&rsquo;s <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal</span> destiny on the basis of what nation they belong to, for unbelieving nations have believers within them, and nations that exhibit more conformity to God&rsquo;s revealed will still have many wicked within them. And &ldquo;God shows no partiality&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.11">Rom. 2:11</a>). Though indeed &ldquo;all the nations&rdquo; are gathered before Christ&rsquo;s throne in this scene (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.32">Matt. 25:32</a>), the picture of judgment is one of judgment on individuals (sheep are separated from goats, and those individuals who treated Christ&rsquo;s brothers kindly are welcomed into the kingdom while those who rejected them are rejected, vv. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.35-40">35&ndash;40</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.42-45">42&ndash;45</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">B. The Time of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Judgment</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The final judgment will occur after the millennium and the rebellion that occurs at the end of it. John pictures the millennial kingdom and the removal of Satan from influence on the earth in <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.1-6">Revelation 20:1&ndash;6</a> (see the discussion in the previous two chapters) and then says that &ldquo;when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations … to gather them for battle&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.7-8">Rev. 20:7&ndash;8</a>). After God decisively defeats this final rebellion (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.9-10">Rev. 20:9&ndash;10</a>), John tells us that judgment will follow: &ldquo;Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it&rdquo; (v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.11">11</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">C. The Nature of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Judgment</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Will Be the Judge</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Paul speaks of &ldquo;Jesus Christ who is to judge the living and the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Ti4.1">2 Tim. 4:1</a>). Peter says that Jesus Christ &ldquo;is the one ordained by God to be the judge of the living and the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ac10.42">Acts 10:42</a>; compare <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac17.31">17:31</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-33">Matt. 25:31&ndash;33</a>). This right to act as judge over the whole universe is something that the Father has given to the Son: &ldquo;The Father … has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn5.26-27">John 5:26&ndash;27</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Unbelievers Will Be Judged</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> It is clear that all unbelievers will stand before Christ for judgment, for this judgment includes &ldquo;the dead, great and small&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.12">Rev. 20:12</a>), and Paul says that &ldquo;on the day of wrath when God&rsquo;s righteous judgment will be revealed,&rdquo; &ldquo;he will render to every man according to his works … for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.5-7">Rom. 2:5&ndash;7</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This judgment of unbelievers will include <span style="font-style:italic;">degrees of punishment</span> for we read that the dead were judged &ldquo;by what they had done&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.12">Rev. 20:12</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.13">13</a>), and this <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1143  </span>judgment according to what people had done must therefore involve an evaluation of the works that people have done. Similarly, Jesus says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		And that servant who knew his master&rsquo;s will, but did not make ready or act according to his will, shall receive a severe beating. But he who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, shall receive a light beating&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk12.47-48">Luke 12:47&ndash;48</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When Jesus says to the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida, &ldquo;It shall be <span style="font-style:italic;">more tolerable</span> on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.22">Matt. 11:22</a>; compare v. <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt11.24">24</a>), or when he says that the scribes &ldquo;will receive the <span style="font-style:italic;">greater condemnation</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk20.47">Luke 20:47</a>), he implies that there will be degrees of punishment on the last day.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In fact, every wrong deed done will be remembered and taken account of in the punishment that is meted out on that day, because &ldquo;on the day of judgment men will render account for every careless word they utter&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt12.36">Matt. 12:36</a>). Every word spoken, every deed done will be brought to light and receive judgment: &ldquo;For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ec12.14">Eccl. 12:14</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As these verses indicate, on the day of judgment the secrets of people&rsquo;s hearts will be revealed and made public. Paul speaks of the day when &ldquo;God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.16">Rom. 2:16</a>; compare <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk8.17">Luke 8:17</a>). &ldquo;Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. Therefore <span style="font-style:italic;">whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed upon the housetops</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk12.2-3">Luke 12:2&ndash;3</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Believers Will Be Judged</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> In writing to Christians Paul says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God …</span> . Each of us shall give account of himself to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro14.10">Rom. 14:10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro14.12">12</a>). He also tells the Corinthians, &ldquo;For <span style="font-style:italic;">we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body</span> whether good or bad&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.6-11">Rom. 2:6&ndash;11</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.12">Rev. 20:12</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.15">15</a>). In addition, the picture of the final judgment in <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.31-46">Matthew 25:31&ndash;46</a> includes Christ separating the sheep from the goats, and rewarding those who receive his blessing.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is important to realize that this judgment of believers will be a judgment to evaluate and bestow various degrees of reward (see below), but the fact that they will face such a judgment should never cause believers to fear that they will be eternally condemned. Jesus says, &ldquo;He who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; <span style="font-style:italic;">he does not come into judgment</span> but has passed from death to life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jn5.24">John 5:24</a>). Here &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; must be understood in the sense of eternal condemnation and death, since it is contrasted with passing from death into life. At the day of final judgment more than at any other time, it is of utmost importance that &ldquo;there is therefore now <span style="font-style:italic;">no condemnation for those who are in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Christ </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1144  </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro8.1">Rom. 8:1</a>). Thus the day of judgment can be portrayed as one in which believers are rewarded and unbelievers are punished:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, <span style="font-style:italic;">for rewarding your servants</span> the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re11.18">Rev. 11:18</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Will all the secret words and deeds of believers, and all their sins, also be revealed on that last day? We might at first think so, because, Paul says that when the Lord comes he will &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">bring to light the things now hidden in darkness</span> and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then every man will receive his commendation from God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co4.5">1 Cor. 4:5</a>; compare <a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.25">Col. 3:25</a>). However, this is a context that talks about &ldquo;commendation&rdquo; or praise (<span style="font-family:Sirba GRK;" lang="el">ἔπαινος</span>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/GreekGK.GGK2047">G2047</a>) that comes from God, so it may not refer to sins. And other verses suggest that God will never again call our sins to remembrance: &ldquo;You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mic7.19">Mic. 7:19</a>); &ldquo;as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps103.12">Ps. 103:12</a>); &ldquo;I will not remember your sins&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Is43.25">Isa. 43:25</a>); &ldquo;I will remember their sins no more.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb8.12">Heb. 8:12</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.17">10:17</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Scripture also teaches that there will be <span style="font-style:italic;">degrees of reward for believers</span>. Paul encourages the Corinthians to be careful how they build the church on the foundation that has already been laid&mdash;Jesus Christ himself.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw&mdash;each man&rsquo;s work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. <span style="font-style:italic;">If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward</span>. If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire. (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.12-15">1 Cor. 3:12&ndash;15</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Paul similarly says of Christians that &ldquo;we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive <span style="font-style:italic;">what is due him for the things done while in the body</span> whether good or bad&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Co5.10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>), again implying degrees of reward for what we have done in this life. Likewise, in the parable of the pounds, the one who made ten pounds more was told, &ldquo;You shall have authority over ten cities,&rdquo; and the one whose pound had made five pounds more was told, &ldquo;And you are to be over five cities&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk19.17">Luke 19:17</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk19.19">19</a>). Many other passages likewise teach or imply degrees of reward for believers at the final judgment.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		But we must guard against misunderstanding here: Even though there will be degrees of reward in heaven, the joy of each person will be full and complete for eternity. If we ask how this can be when there are different degrees of reward, it simply shows that our perception of happiness is based on the assumption that happiness depends on what we possess or the status or power that we have. In actuality, however, our true happiness consists in delighting in God and rejoicing in the status and recognition that he has given us. The foolishness of thinking that only those who have been highly rewarded and given great status will be fully happy in heaven is seen when we realize that no matter how great a reward we are <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1145  </span>given, there will always be those with greater rewards, or who have higher status and authority, including the apostles, the heavenly creatures, and Jesus Christ and God himself. Therefore if highest status were essential for people to be fully happy, no one but God would be fully happy in heaven, which is certainly an incorrect idea. Moreover, those with greater reward and honor in heaven, those nearest the throne of God, delight not in their status but only in the privilege of falling down before God&rsquo;s throne to worship him (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Re4.10-11">Rev. 4:10&ndash;11</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It would be morally and spiritually beneficial for us to have a greater consciousness of this clear New Testament teaching on degrees of heavenly reward. Rather than making us competitive with one another, it would cause us to help and encourage one another that we all may increase our heavenly reward, for God has an infinite capacity to bring blessing to us all, and we are all members of one another (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co12.26-27">1 Cor. 12:26&ndash;27</a>). We would more eagerly heed the admonition of the author of Hebrews, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works</span> not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but <span style="font-style:italic;">encouraging one another</span> and all the more as you see the Day drawing near&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Heb10.24-25">Heb. 10:24&ndash;25</a>). Moreover, in our own lives a heartfelt seeking of future heavenly reward would motivate us to work wholeheartedly for the Lord at whatever task he calls us to, whether great or small, paid or unpaid. It would also make us long for his approval rather than for wealth or success. It would motivate us to work at building up the church on the one foundation, Jesus Christ (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co3.10-15">1 Cor. 3:10&ndash;15</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Angels Will Be Judged</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> Peter says that the rebellious angels have been committed to pits of nether gloom &ldquo;to be kept until the judgment&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a>), and Jude says that rebellious angels have been kept by God &ldquo;until the judgment of the great day&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Jud6">Jude 6</a>). This means that at least the <span style="font-style:italic;">rebellious</span> angels or demons will be subject to judgment on that last day as well.

		Scripture does not clearly indicate whether righteous angels will undergo some kind of evaluation of their service as well, but it is possible that they are included in Paul&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;Do you not know that <span style="font-style:italic;">we are to judge angels?</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.3">1 Cor. 6:3</a>). It is probable that this includes righteous angels because there is no indication in the context that Paul is speaking of demons or fallen angels, and the word &ldquo;angel&rdquo; without further qualification in the New Testament would normally be understood to refer to righteous angels. But the text is not explicit enough to give us certainty.

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. We Will Help in the Work of Judgment</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> It is a rather amazing aspect of New Testament teaching that we (believers) will take part in the process of judgment. Paul says:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Do you not know that <span style="font-style:italic;">the saints will judge the world?</span> And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? Do you not know that <span style="font-style:italic;">we are to judge angels?</span> How much more, matters pertaining to this life? (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.2-3">1 Cor. 6:2&ndash;3</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It might be argued that this simply means we will be watching the declaration of judgment by Christ and approving it, but this does not seem to fit the context well, for here Paul is encouraging the Corinthians to settle legal disputes among <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1146  </span>themselves rather than taking them to court before unbelievers. In this very context he says, &ldquo;Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between members of the brotherhood, but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.5-6">1 Cor. 6:5&ndash;6</a>). This kind of judgment certainly involves careful evaluation and wise discernment. And this implies that such careful evaluation and discernment will be exercised by us in judging angels and in judging the world on the day of final judgment.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This is similar to the teaching of <a href="https://ref.ly/Re20">Revelation 20</a>, where John says that he saw thrones, and &ldquo;seated on them were <span style="font-style:italic;">those to whom judgment was committed</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.4">Rev. 20:4</a>). Although the text does not explain the identity of those seated on the thrones, the fact that they are mentioned in the plural indicates that Christ does not reserve every aspect of the process of judging for himself alone. Indeed, he tells his twelve disciples that they will &ldquo;sit on twelve thrones, <span style="font-style:italic;">judging</span> the twelve tribes of Israel&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt19.28">Matt. 19:28</a>; compare <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk22.30">Luke 22:30</a>). This accords with the fact that throughout the history of redemption God has from time to time given the right to exercise judgment into the hands of human authorities, whether Moses and the elders who assisted him, the judges of Israel whom God raised up during the period of the judges, the wise kings such as David and Solomon, the civil government of many nations (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro13.1-7">Rom. 13:1&ndash;7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.13-14">1 Peter 2:13&ndash;14</a>), or those who have authority to rule and govern within the church and to oversee the exercise of church discipline.

		Since when believers die they pass immediately into the presence of God, and when unbelievers die they pass into a state of separation from God and the endurance of punishment, we may wonder why God has a time of final judgment established at all. Berkhof wisely points out that the final judgment is not for the purpose of letting God find out the condition of our hearts or the pattern of conduct of our lives, for he already knows that in every detail. Berkhof rather says of the final judgment:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It will serve the purpose rather of displaying before all rational creatures the declarative glory of God in a formal, forensic act, which magnifies on the one hand His holiness and righteousness, and on the other hand, His grace and mercy. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the judgment at the last day will differ from that of the death of each individual in more than one respect. It will not be secret, but public; it will not pertain to the soul only, but also to the body; it will not have reference to a single individual, but to all men.

		Scripture clearly affirms that God will be entirely just in his judgment and no one will be able to complain against him on that day. God is the one who &ldquo;judges each one impartially according to his deeds&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe1.17">1 Peter 1:17</a>), and &ldquo;God shows no <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1147  </span>partiality&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro2.11">Rom. 2:11</a>; compare <a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.25">Col. 3:25</a>). For this reason, on the last day &ldquo;every mouth&rdquo; will be &ldquo;stopped,&rdquo; and the whole world will be &ldquo;held accountable to God&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.19">Rom. 3:19</a>), with no one being able to complain that God has treated him or her unfairly. In fact, one of the great blessings of the final judgment will be that saints and angels will see demonstrated in millions of lives the absolutely pure justice of God, and this will be a source of praise to him for all eternity. At the time of the judgment on wicked Babylon, there will be great praise in heaven, for John says, &ldquo;I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah!</span> Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for <span style="font-style:italic;">his judgments are true and just&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re19.1-2">Rev. 19:1&ndash;2</a>).

	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The doctrine of final judgment has several positive moral influences in our lives.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Doctrine of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Judgment</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Satisfies Our Inward Sense of a Need for Justice in the World</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> The fact that there will be a final judgment assures us that ultimately God&rsquo;s universe is <span style="font-style:italic;">fair</span> for God is in control, and he keeps accurate records and renders just judgment. When Paul tells slaves to be submissive to their masters, he reassures them, &ldquo;For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Col3.25">Col 3:25</a>). When the picture of a final judgment mentions the fact that &ldquo;books were opened&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.12">Rev. 20:12</a>; compare <a href="https://ref.ly/Mal3.16">Mal. 3:16</a>), it reminds us (whether the books are literal or symbolic) that a permanent and accurate record of all our deeds has been kept by God, and ultimately all accounts will be settled and all will be made right.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. The Doctrine of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Judgment</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Enables Us to </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Forgive</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Others Freely</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> We realize that it is not up to us to take revenge on others who have wronged us, or even to want to do so, because God has reserved that right for himself. &ldquo;Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;</span> (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro12.19">Rom. 12:19</a>). In this way whenever we have been wronged, we can give into God&rsquo;s hands any desire to harm or pay back the person who has wronged us, knowing that every wrong in the universe will ultimately be paid for&mdash;either it will turn out to have been paid for by Christ when he died on the cross (if the wrongdoer becomes a Christian), or it will be paid for at the final judgment (for those who do not trust in Christ for salvation). But in either case we can give the situation into God&rsquo;s hands, and then pray that the wrongdoer will trust Christ for salvation and thereby receive forgiveness of his or her sins. This thought should keep us from harboring bitterness or resentment in our hearts for injustices we have suffered that have not been made right: God is just, and we can leave these situations in his hands, knowing that he will someday right all wrongs and give absolutely fair rewards and punishments. In this way we are following in the example of Christ, who &ldquo;when he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but <span style="font-style:italic;">he trusted to him who judges justly</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe2.22-23">1 Peter 2:22&ndash;23</a>). He also prayed, &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk23.34">Luke 23:34</a>; compare <a href="https://ref.ly/Ac7.60">Acts 7:60</a>, where Stephen followed Jesus&rsquo; example in praying for those who put him to death).

The Doctrine of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Judgment</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Provides a Motive for Righteous Living</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> For believers, the final judgment is an incentive to faithfulness and good works, not as a means of earning forgiveness of sins, but as a means of gaining greater eternal reward. This is a healthy and good motive for us&mdash;Jesus tells us, &ldquo;Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt6.20">Matt. 6:20</a>)&mdash;though it runs counter to the popular views of our secular culture, a culture that does not really believe in heaven or eternal rewards at all.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		For unbelievers, the doctrine of final judgment still provides some moral restraint on their lives. If in a society there is a widespread general acknowledgment that all will someday give account to the Creator of the universe for their lives, some &ldquo;fear of God&rdquo; will characterize many people&rsquo;s lives. By contrast, those who have no deep consciousness of final judgment give themselves up to greater and greater evil, demonstrating that &ldquo;there is <span style="font-style:italic;">no fear of God</span> before their eyes&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro3.18">Rom. 3:18</a>). Those who deny the final judgment, Peter says, will be &ldquo;scoffers&rdquo; who &ldquo;will come in the last days with scoffing, <span style="font-style:italic;">following their own passions</span> and saying, &ldquo;Where is the promise of his coming?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.3-4">2 Peter 3:3&ndash;4</a>). He also declares that evildoers who &ldquo;are surprised that you do not now join them in the same wild profligacy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;who abuse you&rdquo; will nonetheless &ldquo;give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/1Pe4.4-5">1 Peter 4:4&ndash;5</a>). An awareness of final judgment is both a comfort to believers and a warning to unbelievers not to continue in their evil ways.

In fact, Peter indicates that the delay of the Lord&rsquo;s return is due to the fact that God &ldquo;is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.9">2 Peter 3:9</a>).

		<span style="font-weight:bold;">G. Hell</span>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It is appropriate to discuss the doctrine of hell in connection with the doctrine of final judgment. We may define hell as follows: <span style="font-style:italic;">Hell is a place of eternal conscious punishment for the wicked</span>. Scripture teaches in several passages that there is such a place. At the end of the parable of the talents, the master says, &ldquo;Cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.30">Matt. 25:30</a>). This is one among several indications that there will be consciousness of punishment after the final judgment. Similarly, at the judgment the king will say to some, &ldquo;Depart from me, you cursed, into <span style="font-style:italic;">the eternal fire</span> prepared for the devil and his angels&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.41">Matt. 25:41</a>), and Jesus says that those thus condemned &ldquo;will go away into <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal punishment</span> but the righteous into eternal life&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.46">Matt. 25:46</a>). <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1149  </span>In this text, the parallel between &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; and &ldquo;eternal punishment&rdquo; indicates that both states will be without end.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Jesus refers to hell as &ldquo;the unquenchable fire&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk9.43">Mark 9:43</a>), and says that hell is a place &ldquo;where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mk9.48">Mark 9:48</a>). The story of the rich man and Lazarus also indicates a horrible consciousness of punishment:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The rich man also died and was buried; and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom, and he called out, &ldquo;Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.22-24">Luke 16:22&ndash;24</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		He then begs Abraham to send Lazarus to his father&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come into <span style="font-style:italic;">this place of torment</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lk16.28">Luke 16:28</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		When we turn to Revelation, the descriptions of this eternal punishment are also very explicit:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink the wine of God&rsquo;s wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of his anger, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. <span style="font-style:italic;">And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image</span> and whoever receives the mark of its name. (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re14.9-11">Rev. 14:9&ndash;11</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This passage very clearly affirms the idea of eternal conscious punishment of unbelievers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With respect to the judgment on the wicked city of Babylon, a large multitude in heaven cries, &ldquo;Hallelujah! <span style="font-style:italic;">The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re19.3">Rev. 19:3</a>). After the final rebellion of Satan is crushed, we read, &ldquo;The devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false prophet were, and <span style="font-style:italic;">they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever</span>&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re20.10">Rev. 20:10</a>). This passage is also significant in connection with <a href="https://ref.ly/Mt25.41">Matthew 25:41</a>, in which unbelievers are sent &ldquo;into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.&rdquo; These verses should make us realize the immensity of the evil that is found in sin and rebellion against God, and the magnitude of the holiness and the justice of God that calls forth this kind of punishment.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The idea that there will be <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal</span> conscious punishment of unbelievers has been denied recently even by some evangelical theologians. It has previously been denied by the Seventh Day Adventist Church and by various individuals throughout church history. Those who deny eternal conscious punishment often advocate &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">annihilationism</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span>&rdquo; a teaching that, after the wicked have suffered the <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1150  </span>penalty of God&rsquo;s wrath for a time, God will &ldquo;annihilate&rdquo; them so that they no longer exist. Many who believe in annihilationism also hold to the reality of final judgment and punishment for sin, but they argue that after sinners have suffered for a certain period of time, bearing the wrath of God against their sin, they will finally cease to exist. The punishment will therefore be &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; but it will not be &ldquo;eternal.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Arguments advanced in favor of annihilationism are: (1) the biblical references to the <span style="font-style:italic;">destruction</span> of the wicked, which, some say, implies that they will no longer exist after they are destroyed (<a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.19">Phil. 3:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th5.3">1 Thess. 5:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Th1.9">2 Thess. 1:9</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.7">2 Peter 3:7</a>; et al.); (2) the apparent inconsistency of eternal conscious punishment with the <span style="font-style:italic;">love of God;</span> (3) the apparent injustice involved in the <span style="font-style:italic;">disproportion</span> between sins committed in time and punishment that is eternal; and (4) the fact that the <span style="font-style:italic;">continuing presence of evil creatures in God&rsquo;s universe</span> will eternally mar the perfection of a universe that God created to reflect his glory.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In response, it must be said that the passages which speak of <span style="font-style:italic;">destruction</span> (such as <a href="https://ref.ly/Php3.19">Phil. 3:19</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1Th5.3">1 Thess. 5:3</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2Th1.9">2 Thess. 1:9</a>; and <a href="https://ref.ly/2Pe3.7">2 Peter 3:7</a>) do not necessarily imply the cessation of existence, for in these passages the terms used for &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; do not necessarily imply a ceasing to exist or some kind of annihilation, but can simply be ways of referring to the harmful and destructive effects of final judgment on unbelievers.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		With respect to the argument from the love of God, the same difficulty in reconciling God&rsquo;s love with eternal punishment would seem to be present in reconciling God&rsquo;s love with the idea of divine punishment at all, and, conversely, if (as Scripture abundantly testifies) it is consistent for God to punish the wicked for a certain length of time after the last judgment, then there seems to be no necessary reason why it would be inconsistent of God to inflict the same punishment for an unending period of time.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		This kind of reasoning may lead some people to adopt another kind of annihilationism, one in which there is no conscious suffering at all, not even for a brief time, and the only punishment is that unbelievers cease to exist after they die. But, in response, it may be wondered whether this kind of immediate annihilation can really be called a punishment, since there would be no consciousness of pain. In fact, the guarantee that there would be a cessation of existence would seem to many people, especially those who are suffering and in difficulty in this life, to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1151  </span>in some ways a desirable alternative. And if there was no punishment of unbelievers at all, even people like Hitler and Stalin would have nothing coming to them, and there would be no ultimate justice in the universe. Then people would have great incentive to be as wicked as possible in this life.
	</p>

		The argument that <span style="font-style:italic;">eternal</span> punishment is unfair (because there is a disproportion between temporary sin and eternal punishment) wrongly assumes that we know the extent of the evil done when sinners rebel against God. David Kingdon observes that &ldquo;sin against the Creator is heinous to a degree utterly beyond our sin-warped imaginations&rsquo; [ability] to conceive of … Who would have the temerity to suggest to God what the punishment … should be?&rdquo; He also responds to this objection by suggesting that unbelievers in hell may go on sinning and receiving punishment for their sin, but never repenting, and notes that <a href="https://ref.ly/Re22.11">Revelation 22:11</a> points in this direction: &ldquo;Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		At this point, moreover, an argument based on God&rsquo;s justice may be brought against annihilationism. Does the short time of punishment envisaged by the annihilationist actually <span style="font-style:italic;">pay</span> for all of the unbeliever&rsquo;s sin and satisfy God&rsquo;s justice? If it does not, then God&rsquo;s justice has not been satisfied and the unbeliever should not be annihilated. But if it does, then the unbeliever should be allowed to go to heaven, and he or she should not be annihilated. In either case, annihilationism is not necessary or right.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Regarding the fourth argument, while evil <span style="font-style:italic;">that remains unpunished</span> does detract from God&rsquo;s glory in the universe, we also must realize that when God <span style="font-style:italic;">punishes</span> evil and <span style="font-style:italic;">triumphs</span> over it, the glory of his justice, righteousness, and power to triumph over all opposition will be seen (see <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.17">Rom. 9:17</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.22-24">22&ndash;24</a>). The depth of the riches of God&rsquo;s mercy will also then be revealed, for all redeemed sinners will recognize that they too deserve such punishment from God and have avoided it only by God&rsquo;s grace through Jesus Christ (cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.23-24">Rom. 9:23&ndash;24</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Yet after all this has been said, we have to admit that the ultimate resolution of the depths of this question lies far beyond our ability to understand, and remains hidden in the counsels of God. Were it not for the scriptural passages cited above which so clearly affirm eternal conscious punishment, annihilationism might seem to us to be an attractive option. Though annihilationism can be countered by theological arguments, it is ultimately the clarity and forcefulness of the passages themselves that convince us that annihilationism is incorrect and that Scripture does indeed teach the eternal conscious punishment of the wicked.

		What are we to think of this doctrine? It is hard&mdash;and it should be hard&mdash;for us to think of this doctrine today. If our hearts are never moved with deep sorrow when we contemplate this doctrine, then there is a serious deficiency in our <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1152  </span>spiritual and emotional sensibilities. When Paul thinks of the lostness of his kinsmen the Jews, he says, &ldquo;I have <span style="font-style:italic;">great sorrow</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">unceasing anguish</span> in my heart&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ro9.2">Rom. 9:2</a>). This is consistent with what God tells us of his own sorrow at the death of the wicked: &ldquo;As I live, says the Lord God, <span style="font-style:italic;">I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</span> but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eze33.11">Ezek. 33:11</a>). And Jesus&rsquo; agony is evident as he cries out, &ldquo;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Mt23.37-38">Matt. 23:37&ndash;38</a>; cf. <a href="https://ref.ly/Lk19.41-42">Luke 19:41&ndash;42</a>).
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		The reason it is hard for us to think of the doctrine of hell is because God has put in our hearts a portion of his own love for people created in his image, even his love for sinners who rebel against him. As long as we are in this life, and as long as we see and think about others who need to hear the gospel and trust in Christ for salvation, it should cause us great distress and agony of spirit to think about eternal punishment. Yet we must also realize that whatever God in his wisdom has ordained and taught in Scripture is <span style="font-style:italic;">right</span>. Therefore we must be careful that we do not hate this doctrine or rebel against it, but rather we should seek, insofar as we are able, to come to the point where we acknowledge that eternal punishment is good and right, because in God there is no unrighteousness at all.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		It may help us to realize that if God were not to execute eternal punishment, then, apparently, his justice would not be satisfied and his glory would not be furthered in the way he deems wise. And it will perhaps also help us to realize that from the perspective of the world to come there is a much greater recognition of the necessity and rightness of eternal punishment. Martyred believers in heaven are heard by John to cry out, &ldquo;O sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth?&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re6.10">Rev. 6:10</a>). Moreover, at the final destruction of Babylon, the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven cries out with praise to God for the rightness of his judgment as they finally see the heinous nature of evil for what it really is:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:18pt; margin-left:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for his judgments are true and just; he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants … Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.&rdquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re19.1-3">Rev. 19:1&ndash;3</a>)
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:9pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		As soon as this happened, &ldquo;the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, &ldquo;Amen. Hallelujah!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (<a href="https://ref.ly/Re19.4">Rev. 19:4</a>). We cannot say that this great multitude of the redeemed and the living creatures in heaven have wrong moral judgment when they praise God for executing justice on evil, for they are all free from sin and their moral judgments are pleasing to God.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		In this present age, however, we should only approach such a celebration of the justice of God in the punishment of evil when we meditate on the eternal punishment given to Satan and his demons. When we think of them we do not instinctively love them, though they too were created by God. But now they are fully devoted to evil and beyond the potential of redemption. So we cannot long <span style="color:rgb(255, 128, 23); font-family:#Libronix User Interface; font-size:9.5pt;">  p 1153  </span>for their salvation as we long for the redemption of all humanity. We must believe that eternal punishment is true and just, yet we should also long that even those people who most severely persecute the church should come to faith in Christ and thus escape eternal condemnation.

		 1. Have you thought before that there will be a final judgment for believers? How do you think of it now? How does the awareness of the fact that we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ affect your life today? What do you think it will feel like to have all your words and deeds made public on that last day? Is there an element of fear as you contemplate that day? If so, meditate on <a href="https://ref.ly/1Jn4.16-18">1 John 4:16&ndash;18</a>:
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:11pt; margin-top:9pt; margin-right:36pt; margin-left:36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. In this is love perfected with us, <span style="font-style:italic;">that we may have confidence for the day of judgment</span> because as he is so are we in this world. <span style="font-style:italic;">There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear</span>. For fear has to do with punishment, and he who fears is not perfected in love.

		 2. Have you previously thought very much about laying up treasures in heaven, or about earning greater heavenly reward? If you really believe this doctrine, what kind of effect do you think it should have on your life?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 3. How do you think it will feel to participate with Christ in the judging of angels, and indeed in the judging of the whole world (see <a href="https://ref.ly/1Co6.2-3">1 Cor. 6:2&ndash;3</a>)? What does the fact that God allows us to participate in this final judgment say about our creation in the image of God and his purposes for us in the universe? How does that make you feel about yourself and your eternal relationship to God?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
		 4. Think of some of your Christian friends in your church. How do you think you will feel when you watch them stand before Christ at the final judgment? How will they feel about you at that time? Does the contemplation of this future judgment affect the way you think of your fellowship with each other as brothers and sisters in Christ today?
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">

	</p>
	<p style="font-size:12pt; margin-left:36pt; text-indent:-36pt; text-align:justify;" lang="en-US">
